      <h2>How Kmart Became a Retail Icon</h2>
      <p>
        Kmart has become a cornerstone of budget shopping in New Zealand, offering a broad range of affordable products. Founded in Australia in 1969, the brand expanded into New Zealand, where it quickly gained a following for providing everyday essentials at low prices. Its model of large-format stores filled with homeware, clothing, and electronics has made it a favorite for families and bargain hunters.
