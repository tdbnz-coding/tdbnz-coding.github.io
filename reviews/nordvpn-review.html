      <h2><strong>Why Use a VPN?</strong></h2>
      <p>
        A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, routing it through secure servers to mask your IP address and location. This prevents third parties like 
        hackers, ISPs, and government agencies from tracking your activities online. NordVPN also allows users to bypass regional restrictions, 
        granting access to streaming services and websites unavailable in certain countries.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Keep your internet activities hidden from prying eyes.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Protect your data, especially when using public Wi-Fi networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> Unblock geo-restricted content and services.</li>
      </ul>
