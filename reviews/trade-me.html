      <h2>How Trade Me Came to Be</h2>
      <p>
        In 1999, Sam Morgan saw an opportunity to create New Zealand’s first online marketplace after experiencing frustration with outdated newspaper classifieds. With a small team, Trade Me launched as a site for buying, selling, and auctioning goods, with real-time listings that quickly became popular.
