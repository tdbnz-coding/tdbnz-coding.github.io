      <h2>What is Trade Me?</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.trademe.co.nz" target="_blank">Trade Me</a> is New Zealand’s largest online marketplace, where users can buy, sell, and auction items. 
        Since its launch in 1999, it has grown to become a hub for second-hand goods, property listings, cars, and job postings. 
        With millions of active users, it is often considered New Zealand’s equivalent of eBay, but with a much broader reach into real estate, motor vehicles, and employment.
