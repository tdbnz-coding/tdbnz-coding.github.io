      <h2>How Trade Me Came to Be</h2>
      <p>
        Back in 1999, the idea of buying from strangers online seemed unusual for many New Zealanders, but **Sam Morgan** saw an opportunity. Frustrated by the outdated newspaper classifieds while searching for a heater, he realized the potential for a digital marketplace. Combining his IT expertise with this idea, Sam developed the first version of Trade Me in just six weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the time, the concept of live online auctions was rare in New Zealand, but it was quickly implemented on the new platform. Trade Me launched with four employees and a small group of 20 members, mostly friends and family.

      <h2>Growth of Trade Me</h2>
      <p>
        From its humble beginnings, Trade Me quickly grew. Sam tirelessly promoted the platform by driving around Wellington in a bright green Holden with Trade Me branding and distributing flyers. By the end of its first few months, the site reached 1,000 users, and by 2003, the number had skyrocketed to 100,000 members.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2004, Trade Me was recognized as New Zealand’s fastest-growing company at the Deloitte/Unlimited Fast 50 Awards. By 2006, the platform had over a million registered members and had become the most visited website in New Zealand, averaging over two million visitors per month.

      <h2>The Sale and Transition</h2>
      <p>
        In 2006, Sam Morgan sold Trade Me to Fairfax Media for NZ$700 million, though he continued as CEO until 2008, when he passed the leadership to Jon McDonald. Trade Me’s influence continued to grow, leading to its public listing on both the NZX and ASX in 2011 under the ticker "TME".
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2019, Apax Partners acquired the company for NZ$2.56 billion, delisting it from the stock market. Leadership changed again as Anders Skoe took over as CEO, guiding the company into its latest chapter.
