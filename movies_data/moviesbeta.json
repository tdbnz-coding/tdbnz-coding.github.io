Renowned for his boxing skills, speed and ability to slip punches, the famed southpaw became an oriental champion at all weights from bantamweight to lightweight. To this day, Elorde holds the junior lightweight division for the longest title reign of nearly seven-and-a-half years, defending the crown he won with a spectacular 7th round knockout of Harold Gomes before 26,000 screaming fans at the inauguration of the Araneta Coliseum on March 16, 1960, 10 times against the top contenders. Elorde was the first Asian inducted into the New York-based International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1993 and was also enshrined in the World Boxing Hall of Fame. With his skills and humility both inside and outside the ring, \"Flash\" Elorde will always remain a tribute to the sport. He was a quintessential Filipino who \"feared no man but was humble before all men.\"",

Then suddenly things change dramatically when Vinay suspects Deepak of accepting bribes from a corrupt builder named Shaadilal, fires Deepak, pending a police investigation. And to make matters worse, Shankar too is aware of Deepak - not as a groom for his niece, but as a suspect for murder!!

When a young man dreams that he drowns after a night of carnal passion, he asks a buddhist monk to translate the experience for him. The monk replies that the dream is a warning not to indulge the pleasures of the flesh to excess, but the man ignores his advice, marrying a virgin and making love to her constantly. However, after several torrid affairs, the man begins to realise the sagacity of the monk's warning.",

Cesar proposes that Iker film the preparation and execution of a revenge killing. Iker accepts with the goal of filming the preparation, but of stopping the crime before it actually takes place. Iker investigates the case of the murdered youth and the strange circumstances surrounding it. Meanwhile Cesar fine tunes his plan to manipulate the penal code to eliminate or at least minimize any punishment for the crime he is planning, so as to show how justice is an illusion. As he designs the plan to avenge himself on Fabian Arias, the alleged killer of his son, he uses the penal code and his plans for a legal defense to decide the form, timing and manner in which he will carry out his version of Justice.",

The residents pool their resources to save their houses, but the money that's collected is stolen. When he's jailed for the theft, Kazablan must find a way to clear himself.",

      "overview": "Young master Ying Feng is kicked out of home by his father, a master of mystical magic cures, because the \"leader of black religion\" is out to kill his entire family. Honest and stout-hearted, Ying Feng punches three guys who want to screw pretty dancer Miss Fan. Fan gets sweet on Feng and he agrees to let her stay with him. The Fairy comes to town, touting his magic powers to cure the sick for anyone who'll pay his exorbitant fee. Ying Feng has some of the same talent, and cures a sick woman with no money and for no payment, thereby shaming The Fairy into both taking him on as a disciple and agreeing to charge less. Li Quan, the \"leader of black religion\", has not given up trying to find Ying Feng, but his search is greatly slowed down by his assistants being far more interested in screwing each other silly than revenge. Note - Both of the lead characters are actually called \"Fung\" in Cantonese, so I have used the Mandarin forms of their names, to distinguish them.",

Louise Fleck presents her drama about the untimeliness of restrictive abortion legislation against the backdrop of modern urban reality. Seriousness, however, is preserved, because topics such as unwanted pregnancy, sexual violence, and the consequences of improperly performed abortions are not only addressed through minor characters, but also placed at the center of the cinematic narrative.

Gradually everything the boy was attached to starts to fall apart around him, and if his dead father hadn’t visited him he wouldn’t even know which path to take. The inexperience of youth, loneliness, and impulsiveness prevent him from using reason and cool consideration to face the obstacles in his way, and he even sometimes provokes those who stand by him. And thus he finds himself in a situation for which there is only one solution.",

He has made a mess of his life — his marriage is in trouble, since he is pathologically cheating on his wife; his parents (Yosef Millo and Orna Porat) have separated; and his father arrives for an extended visit from Nahariya. Giora spends time with his army buddies, recalling their experiences during the War in Lebanon. His father is undergoing a major life crisis and finds both the loneliness of the city and his son's lifestyle unappealing. As a non-Jew in a Jewish society, he feels estranged, an outsider who has never been able to adapt, and contemplates suicide. Eventually, Giora's parents decide to attempt a reconciliation, until tragedy strikes.",

Despite being without his regular cohorts Ku Lung and Ti Lung here, Chu shows his master stroke as he delves into the dastardly ways of evil warlords in China back in the 1910’s. Drama and action both take centre-stage as Tsung Hua and Ching Li fall prey to a lecherous general (Stanley Feng Tsui-fan) who rapes and forces the latter to become his concubine. With the help of two street performers (the deft and agile Chen Kuan-tai and Shih Szu) he once helped, Tsung hatches a plot to save his beloved – with deadly consequences.",

When Maury gets his big break, Sam wants a part in his show, but when Maury, who is unwilling to cast Sam in the production, turns down Sam's request, Sam seduces and marries Maury's girlfriend (Shirley MacLaine). In spite of everything, Maury wants his girl back, and Sam agrees to a divorce on the stipulation that Maury cast him as the star in his next show. Once again, Maury reneges and, before Sam can exact his revenge, Uncle Sam comes to the rescue and he is drafted into the army.",

      "overview": "As a response to criticism for the allegedly excessive “mass appeal” of his  earlier epic STORM OVER ASIA (1928), Vsevolod Pudovkin unleashed his flair  for experimentation in what was supposed to be the director’s first sound  feature. Everything went wrong: technical problems forced him to complete  the film as a silent; viewers were baffled by the lack of a recognizable  plot; then, the ideological climate of the Soviet Union changed. He was  now being blamed for catering to bourgeois taste! Time has come to set  the record straight. Here’s lyrical cinema at its best, deliberately operatic  and yet intimate as it matches the characters’ inner life with the solemn  rhythms of nature, and depicted through breathtaking black-and-white  photography. A sensation at last year’s Pordenone fest, Pudovkin’s  long-forgotten swan song to the art of montage is resurrected by Gabriel  Thibaudeau’s emotionally charged live music performance. –PCU (USSR,  1930, 75m)",

Interviews with medical, legal and intelligence experts and evidence from declassified government memos document what has been called the greatest scandal in American medical ethics. Based on four years of research by Producer/Director Martha Davis, written by Oscar winning Mark Jonathan Harris, and filmed in HD by Emmy winning DP Lisa Rinzler, the film shows how the torture of detainees could not continue without the assistance of the doctors.",

Told through the story of Xishi (Hsi Shih), one of the 'Four Great Beauties' of Chinese history, the film portrays the war between two Chinese Kingdoms during the Warring States Period (475-221 B.C). After the kingdom of Yue is defeated by the kingdom of Wu, King Goujian of Yue takes pains to prepare for his revenge and rebuild his country. Knowing that King Fucha of Wu is lewd and lustful, he offers Xisi to the court of Wu to serve as Fucha’s concubine, with Fucha unaware that she is also a spy. She uses her charm to draw Fucha away from his office and governance, while King Goujian rallies his forces together to attempt to reclaim his lands.",

      "overview": "The Island of the Lost (German: Die Insel der Verschollenen) is a 1921 German silent science fiction film . It is a loose unauthorized adaptation of the 1896 novel The Island of Doctor Moreau by H. G. Wells. Author Wells was allegedly unaware that this unauthorized version of his novel existed.\r Thought at one time to have been lost, a print has turned up at the Bundesarchiv in Berlin, Germany. The film was only screened in the US for the first time at a \"Monster Bash\" convention in 2014. Comments from the attendees included the fact that the film was somewhat illogical, and had more emphasis on comedy and romance than horror, but that it offered \"memorable glimpses of human-animal hybrids\".",
