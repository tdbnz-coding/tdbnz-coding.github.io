Yet, even within their central territories, some areas refused to bow to the Genghisids. Kozelsk was one of them.

Now, the people of Kozelsk must face a battle against the strongest army in the world, with no hope of victory. This is a story about people facing their death. Some try to escape, others are willing to do anything to survive, but most are prepared to protect their city from the relentless storms of the Mongolian hordes.",

Kyrath lost his 17-year-old daughter Ann-Marie to a Palestinian asylum seeker who stabbed her and her boyfriend multiple times on a train in Brokstedt two years ago. Since his daughter's death, Michael Kyrath has been lobbying the media and politicians for more control and more removals. In Stuttgart, the reporters are on the road with a police patrol policing a knife-free zone, and the Danish Minister of Migration explains how the Danes have adapted their asylum policy. Presenter Julia Ruhs is also in Aschaffenburg, where a child and a 41-year-old man died in a knife attack in January 2025. She visits the daycare group and speaks with the association's chairman. The documentary report under the new banner KLAR explores the question of what needs to be changed in Germany's asylum policy.",

As it turned out, this detective story began in the distant past, when we were all part of the same System, sacredly looking after its own interests and not leaving alone any of those who once touched the terrible secret.

During this meeting, the Chinese Communist Party corrected the military errors of Wang Ming’s “leftist” leadership and began establishing Mao Zedong’s Marxist line as the guiding force within the Party. This turning point helped save the Party, the Red Army, and the revolution itself.  The film is structured into five key segments: The Great Retreat from the Soviet Base, The Bloody Battle at the Xiang River, Zunyi at Dawn, Crossing the Dadu River, and The Triumphant Meeting in Northern Shaanxi. In the dramatic Dadu River crossing scene, 17 Red Army soldiers brave the treacherous current, with two tragically falling into the river—highlighting the courage and sacrifice that defined this historic journey.",

He interviews many of the game’s great champions and more than a few colorful characters, who are asked the question, “What is the spirit of golf?” We hear from Arnold Palmer, Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Johnny Miller, the wonderfully unique Moe Norman, Kathy Whitworth and Nancy Lopez, and notable teachers such as David Leadbetter, “Butch” Harmon and commentators Herbert Warren Wind, Jack Whitaker, and Jim Nantz. All the answers are marvelously diverse, funny, and poetic… just like the game itself.",

Pitted against highly-trained Tributes who have prepared for these Games their entire lives, Katniss is forced to rely upon her sharp instincts as well as the mentorship of drunken former victor Haymitch Abernathy.  If she’s ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. The world will be watching.",

The way they raise funds (selling pieces of the \"historic\" wall) and struggle against the heartless machinery of bureaucracy forms the axis of the film. In their efforts, the four protagonists are assisted by Regina, a translator familiar with local customs and practices. The film deals with the problems of artists in the new, commercializing reality. It is the story of strangers, auslanders who want to realize their dreams and ambitions outside their homeland. It raises topical issues of chauvinism, xenophobia and hatred of foreigners felt by both Germans and Poles.",

Thought to be feeble-minded at best and crazy at worst, Pavel soon lives up to his enemies' fears: he dismisses long-serving courtiers, demands that peasants only work three days a week, and declares that state officials should start their days at 5 am. Soon, it seems that everyone who can is trying to hatch some kind of plot against him - including his own sons. Sumptuously designed, POOR POOR PAVEL constrasts the imperial splendor of the court with the sordid atmosphere of conspiracies and backstabbing that comes to define these characters' lives.",

This change is seen through the eyes of two Chileans from opposing sides of the political spectrum. They experience a year of turmoil as protests give way to transformation. On the one side Ramiro, a wealthy businessman, and on the other side Mariana, a lower middle-class teacher. Historical conflicts that were long thought resolved come to light as the assembly process draws closer, showing how the wounds of a brutal dictatorship are deep, lasting and must be reconciled at all costs.",

Osorgin received a terrible sentence after he, a deeply religious man, secretly brought holy gifts to the dying Archimandrite so that he could take communion before his death. The camp authorities took the Russian officer's word of honor from Osorgin not to tell his wife anything about his predetermined fate. Only on this condition did they agree to temporarily release him from the punishment cell for his last meeting with Lina. The spouses spend the precious three days allotted to them and feel happy in the most inappropriate circumstances. Osorgin says goodbye to Lina on the pier. When the ship becomes a dot on the horizon, the guards escort George back to the punishment cell, where he carefully dresses for his final journey.",

Osorgin received a terrible sentence after he, a deeply religious man, secretly brought holy gifts to the dying Archimandrite so that he could take communion before his death. The camp authorities took the Russian officer's word of honor from Osorgin not to tell his wife anything about his predetermined fate. Only on this condition did they agree to temporarily release him from the punishment cell for his last meeting with Lina. The spouses spend the precious three days allotted to them and feel happy in the most inappropriate circumstances. Osorgin says goodbye to Lina on the pier. When the ship becomes a dot on the horizon, the guards escort George back to the punishment cell, where he carefully dresses for his final journey.",

Agreeing to Boris's proposal to lay out a stove in his hut, Agnia gradually falls in love with him, but eventually uses him to achieve her main goal — to move to a new apartment. And he does it in a very unusual way.",

Originally left by her parents as a baby with the promise that they'd be back for her someday, it's been a hard knock life ever since with her mean foster mom Miss Hannigan. But everything's about to change when the hard-nosed tycoon and New York mayoral candidate Will Stacks—advised by his brilliant VP and his shrewd and scheming campaign advisor—makes a thinly-veiled campaign move and takes her in. Stacks believes he's her guardian angel, but Annie's self-assured nature and bright, sun-will-come-out-tomorrow outlook on life just might mean it's the other way around.",

In a dream, he meets his teacher, who wants to reconcile with him, but he is obsessed with how to become as “likeable” as his teacher asked him to be. With this in mind, he approaches some entertainment stars. It turns out that all of them live with their own scars, and not all of their hatred can be found in themselves. One of the stars teaches the man a spell that allows him to travel through time and space, to fight against the past, to be brave when courage is needed.",

This change is seen through the eyes of two Chileans from opposing sides of the political spectrum. They experience a year of turmoil as protests give way to transformation. On the one side Ramiro, a wealthy businessman, and on the other side Mariana, a lower middle-class teacher. Historical conflicts that were long thought resolved come to light as the assembly process draws closer, showing how the wounds of a brutal dictatorship are deep, lasting and must be reconciled at all costs.",

Все самые сильные чувства он отдавал музыке. Только её он любил. А что касается людей... Им он позволял любить себя. Ведь только он - солнце, все остальные - лишь планеты. И вот он узнаёт, что такое настоящая страсть, страсть, которая испепеляет его изнутри, сметает на своём пути всё, как лавина. Ради этой страсти он откажется от всего: от денег, семьи, славы. Но будет ли счастлив?",

Everyone needs firewood; you can’t heat a home with art or culture.” Victor’s attitude changes when art and culture become areas of priority for his region’s development. Now, in order to keep his job, Victor has to study Perm region’s cultural heritage. Hoping to make things easier for himself, he takes lessons from art historian Marina.

It's just a peck on the cheek to filmgoers today, but that was the first kiss featured in a movie made after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Not only did it break a taboo on big screen intimacy, but it also made then-23-year-old actress Zhang Yu an idol throughout the country.  Now, 30 years later, Zhang is back as the director presenting a sequel to the classic romance. She says the new film is out to explore the meaning of real love. Attaching 2010 to the original name, the new \"Romance on Lushan Mountain\" appeals to today's audiences.  The film will be released across China on October 5th.",
