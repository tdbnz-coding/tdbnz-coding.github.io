The tensions of the past still loom large in these young Muslims’ lives, and their Olympic dreams are stunted by a lack of state support despite the efforts of their dedicated coach. Director Ryan Sidhoo takes a longitudinal approach in his directorial debut, intimately capturing the boys’ journey as they reckon with growing up under the shadow of the past. A deeply affecting coming-of-age underdog story, The Track is an ode to the power of hope, friendship, and chasing your dreams against all odds.",

His daily routine includes searching for various audition opportunities, submitting resumes, and only receiving audition notices every now and then. To fulfill the dream of becoming a leading actor, he decided to venture into the film and television industry in China and started his Don Quixote journey with pals. The documentary also films other actors and actresses - the girl from the south and Brother Long, and how they experienced gender and age limitations in the industry.

These Magdalene women and the children of the Mother & Baby Homes might still be shrouded in secrecy and shame, if not for the work of Justice For Magdalenes. This tiny group of women lawyers, academics and volunteers have together waged an extraordinary battle on behalf of the survivors of Irish institutions. This documentary tells their story.",

The tensions of the past still loom large in these young Muslims’ lives, and their Olympic dreams are stunted by a lack of state support despite the efforts of their dedicated coach. Director Ryan Sidhoo takes a longitudinal approach in his directorial debut, intimately capturing the boys’ journey as they reckon with growing up under the shadow of the past. A deeply affecting coming-of-age underdog story, The Track is an ode to the power of hope, friendship, and chasing your dreams against all odds.",

Through exclusive interviews and never-before-heard testimony, we reveal how our justice system can fail and lead to convictions in strange and diffuse circumstances.  This film is not about determining Antonio's guilt or innocence, but about examining how the legal process was handled. I highlight flaws in the legal system, where crucial evidence and testimony was ignored, and how this affected everyone involved.  I have had access to people close to the case such as witnesses, friends, family and Antonio himself, who shared his experiences after the verdict - from mental stress to addiction problems. We also hear from family members and others concerned who give their view of the events.",

While job hunting online, David stumbles across the perfect antidote to his boredom: a ‘Swingers’ site. The resulting inbox of lewd invitations on the home-laptop justifiably upsets Alice, until she realises this could be just the ‘story’ she needs.  The idea of uncovering the swinging scene causes quite a stir in Alice’s office and, much to David’s chagrin, she is urged to pursue the story.  Their first reluctant foray is an hysterically low-rent initiation, however, an unexpected upturn for David’s manhood is all the extra encouragement they need.  As events accelerate beyond their control the once adoring couple become lost and fundamental questions are asked of their relationship.",
