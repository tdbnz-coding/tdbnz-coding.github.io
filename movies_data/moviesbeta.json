On the night of the peak performance of the drama, Rini, who played the role of Roro Putri, suddenly became possessed by the spirit of the original Roro Putri and triggered a mass possession among the other participants.

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.",

As they speak about their lives, their ruminations often linger like poetry, noting the sound of snow falling or singing softly along with the radio. They rise with the sun and still tend to their herds at dusk, the soft purple hues tingeing the light as the ranchers reflect on the possibility of being the last of their generation to work this land. Director Tamar Lando’s transportive vérité portrait of the often solitary yet beautiful world of these ranchers is part oral history, part patient ode to a valley in transition.",

They put out an ad on the net to which the well experienced Alex and Timo react. We follow Diana and Julian as they prepare for the arrival of Alex and Timo, who they have invited to their home for the weekend. Diana is nervous. As soon as she is confronted with the self-confident and ravishingly sexy Alex, her insecurity increases even more. Timo seems disinterested, a sharp contrast to the boyish excitement of Julian. But as night falls and their sexual exploration begins, we notice Timo may not be as casual as he initially seemed and Diana on the other hand contains hidden strength. And so we realize there's more to 'Swingers' than just sex. Swingers: could your relationship stand the test?",

The two children have a plan, which will however be abruptly interrupted by an unexpected event.

The main storyline is about Adira’s internal struggle to hook up with Jerome — an attractive man who rescued her at her friend Keke’s birthday party — after months of having no sex due to her trauma. The other storyline is fragmented at first, but her truth is pieced together: Adira was sexually assaulted by her father after being left alone with him due to marital issues. Adira becomes increasingly frustrated with her inability to connect with others due to her trauma, until she decides to take her power back. After a few failed sex attempts with Jerome, she intentionally returns to her childhood flashbacks to kill her abuser.",

But Alex doesn’t ring a bell to celebrate, throw on a cancer ribbon t-shirt, or organize a multi-million dollar fundraiser. Instead, she begs for her daily morphine drip, clings to her radiation mask as a safety blanket, reminisces about gory hospital stories, and plays heart monitor beeps in her headphones to fall asleep. Despite everyone’s high expectations of her, she can’t get herself to play the part of the inspirational survivor. She’s a bad survivor and everybody knows it.",

      "overview": "In Sarajevo, three teenage boys train with their coach on a luge track left over from the 1984 Winter Games, now bullet-riddled, covered in graffiti, and swarmed by tourists. Three decades after the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mirza, Zlatan, and Hamza are the next generation of athletes in a country facing an uncertain future. The tensions of the past still loom large in these young Muslims’ lives, and their Olympic dreams are stunted by a lack of state support despite the efforts of their dedicated coach. Director Ryan Sidhoo takes a longitudinal approach in his directorial debut, intimately capturing the boys’ journey as they reckon with growing up under the shadow of the past. A deeply affecting coming-of-age underdog story, The Track is an ode to the power of hope, friendship, and chasing your dreams against all odds.",

Here she pays tribute to her family’s heritage, bearing witness to its relationship with the land, labor, and resilience. A shapeshifting and playful feature debut, the film is infused with performance, poetry, and animation as Zhao constructs a living archive of oral history and community theater. Summoning the past into the present, May the Soil Be Everywhere chronicles China’s history of war, famine, and rapid urbanization through the lens of four generations in one family.",

He is to build the palace and be covered in gold or, if not, his fate is to be eaten by crocodiles. Edifis calls upon an old friend to help him out: The fabulous Druid Getafix from Gaul, who brews a fantastic potion that gives supernatural strength. In order to help and protect the old Druid, Asterix and Obelix accompany him on his journey to Egypt. When Julius Caesar gets wind of the project succeeding, he has the building site attacked by his troops in order to win the bet and not lose face. But just like the local pirates, he hasn't counted on Asterix and Obelix.",

He becomes addicted to the dream and falls in love with the beautiful female student in it. Unfortunately, the dream is part of the Monk's conspiracy to obtain or destroy all that matters to him. Once Wong finally finishes his dream, things start going horribly badly. For example, his dog loses its head and his mother gets mutilated and stuffed into a box while he was asleep. The dream maker has gained control of Wong through his dreams and his desires and is out to take everything from him.

But his mission is to avenge his father. Lloyd Bridges, late in his career, revealed an aptitude for this kind of silliness, here as a commander who is both incredibly dim and delightfully accident prone. Directed by Jim Abrahams, the film makes fun of a variety of other films as well, from Dances with Wolves to The Fabulous Baker Boys. It was so successful that they all returned in the sequel, Hot Shots! Part Deux.",

This film is not about determining Antonio's guilt or innocence, but about examining how the legal process was handled. I highlight flaws in the legal system, where crucial evidence and testimony was ignored, and how this affected everyone involved.  I have had access to people close to the case such as witnesses, friends, family and Antonio himself, who shared his experiences after the verdict - from mental stress to addiction problems. We also hear from family members and others concerned who give their view of the events.",

Through exclusive interviews and never-before-heard testimony, we reveal how our justice system can fail and lead to convictions in strange and diffuse circumstances.  This film is not about determining Antonio's guilt or innocence, but about examining how the legal process was handled. I highlight flaws in the legal system, where crucial evidence and testimony was ignored, and how this affected everyone involved.  I have had access to people close to the case such as witnesses, friends, family and Antonio himself, who shared his experiences after the verdict - from mental stress to addiction problems. We also hear from family members and others concerned who give their view of the events.",
