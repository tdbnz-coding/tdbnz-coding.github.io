However, Broeck hasn't done anything that would justify the death penalty, so Stuyvesant waits (without much patience) for Broeck to step out of line. Broeck is romancing a beautiful woman named Tina Tienhoven, whose sister Ulda happens to be dating his best friend, Ten Pin. After Stuyvesant's men toss Broeck in jail on a trumped-up charge, Stuyvesant sets his sights on winning Tina's affections.",

When a young man dreams that he drowns after a night of carnal passion, he asks a buddhist monk to translate the experience for him. The monk replies that the dream is a warning not to indulge the pleasures of the flesh to excess, but the man ignores his advice, marrying a virgin and making love to her constantly. However, after several torrid affairs, the man begins to realise the sagacity of the monk's warning.",

The lovely Reiko suffers from a condition known as “genophobia” (the fear of sexual intercourse), so she is admitted to the Tachibana Clinic for observation. Another group of doctors have the “Dream Ring” device and use it on Reiko to analyze her wildly erotic, and violent, dreams and nightmares. The clinic doctors have more sinister reasons to test this device on Reiko, however, and secretly put her under hypnosis so that the ring is activated at any time she hears the sound of a bell. Can she escape the evil doctors’ experiment and, even if she does, who is that strange person, dressed all in black, following her around?",

Some of the events are presumably inspired by real life experiences, others have a distinct air of wishful fabrication. The over-the-top Kung Fu star, deserted by director and crew as he goes through his pointless extended routine, for instance. Or the action heroes, sweating in furs while they dutifully munch through their meal scene, 'snow' falling outside in studio land.",

It is a culebronizado backstage of the rehearsals of the musical Ella, homage to Rafaella Carrá, where Christopher Guest entrenches a group of dancers and choreographers, following them closely in their problems of love and of makeup. It shows situations of contagious pop vitality, and music and dance set the stage for a shocking ending, which kindly suggests rethinking various representation problems: Schipani and Montiel seem to have known in advance that it is dangerous to always tell the truth",

The family took counsel and delegated their youngest son, Dieudonné, a cook by trade. Dieudonné arrived safely in New York, but soon found himself short of money. Somehow, he managed to reach that prodigious corner of Texas where, he thought, his uncle's many factories would be built. Neither the factories nor his uncle, who died in poverty a week ago, welcome him there. Dîeudonné can't imagine returning to his native village to announce this new family disgrace; for one thing, he hasn't got a penny in his pocket. The owner of a modest saloon hires him as a cook.",

Yet, even within their central territories, some areas refused to bow to the Genghisids. Kozelsk was one of them.

On top of everything else, Kayama is heading for a mid-life crisis. The rediscovery of his unfinished student film crystallizes his general sense of dissatisfaction, and leads him to rethink his life and work, to the chagrin of many of his friends, colleagues, and family members.  Mochizuki's quasi-autobiographical début feature observes both the workings of the porn sub-culture and the spiritual problems of its central character.",

Meanwhile, his boss asks him for a favor. Apparently, the bossman’s son is too-o-o serious about a girlfriend, Yuki (Minako Mizushima). The boss wants the relationship destroyed and asks Osamu to arrange an “unforgettable situation.” Osamu and his friends stalk the lovers to a secluded vacation house where rape delirium erupts (although Osamu isn’t capable of participating). A bit later the boss and two women show up, presumably to check on the results.

At the end of the film, there is a dubious reconciliation as Achala is shown following Mahim's 'good' traditionalism with Sharatchandra's barely concealed hostility towards Achala's liberated Brahmo Samaj upbringing.",

Meanwhile, male high school students get involved with a nurse at a hospital run by the perverted doctor—again, with her pet cat watching—and later they even throw orgy parties at their homes with female students. As a result, pubic lice infestations break out among the students, and, inexplicably, the teachers become afflicted as well. Thus, the pubic lice debacle erupts!

This all-star extravaganza pulls out all the stops, with appearances by virtually all of the great actors and actresses from Toei’s studio at the time. Ichikawa Utaemon’s portrayal of the kind-hearted, noble yakuza boss Shigezo of Sasagawa contrasts sharply with the devious Sukegoro of Iioka. Corrupt as he may have been, his men were all willing to give up their lives for him.",
