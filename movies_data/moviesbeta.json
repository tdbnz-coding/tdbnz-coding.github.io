The Emperor Minghuang was so besotted with the woman that when An Lushan stages his rebellion against the empire, the ruler takes Yang Guifei along with his imperial entourage in an escape to the mountainous area of modern-day Sichuan, and sanctuary of sorts. But the concubine had roused the jealousy of the court and unfortunately for her and to the great sorrow of the king, her brother and others among the king's retainers demanded she be strangled to death while they were still in the mountains. This is the story told in this interesting Taiwanese adaptation by director Li Han-hsiang (Li Hanxiang).",

Maria Stuarda was laid to rest for more than a hundred years, finally being revived in 1958 in Bergamo under conductor Oliviero de Fabritiis.

As the two queens, Leyla Gencer and Shirley Verrett, set the vocal standards. Since then, the triumph of Maria Stuarda has been unstoppable.",

In contrast, his up-and-coming colleague Dr. Schäfer sees abortion as a means of helping women in need and openly advocates an amendment of the law. The professor’s convictions are shaken when misfortune befalls his own family. Louise Fleck presents her drama about the untimeliness of restrictive abortion legislation against the backdrop of modern urban reality. Seriousness, however, is preserved, because topics such as unwanted pregnancy, sexual violence, and the consequences of improperly performed abortions are not only addressed through minor characters, but also placed at the center of the cinematic narrative.

      "overview": "\"A woman is born to give her body to men; her father or strangers should make no difference.\"  Respectable Police Commissioner Josephine reinvestigates an insignificant murder case of a 11 years old girl. The murderer is the mother of the victim, Becky. Under intense interrogation, Becky refused to admit that she knew all along that her boyfriend was raping her little daughter at home. The harsh interrogation drives Becky into killing herself. What is the truth that the raging Commissioner is trying to find out? What is the seemingly defenseless mother hiding? Or is she acually telling the truth? Is the phrase, \"A woman is born to give her body to men.\" the whole truth?",

In this epic journey into the picaresque, we follow Emma Bee Bernstein, our intrepid protagonist, from her pre-teen innocence to her late teen-attitude, as she learns about the downtown art scene firsthand. In the process, Hills reimagines the art of video in a style that achieves the density, complexity, and visual richness of his greatest films.",

Maria Stuarda was laid to rest for more than a hundred years, finally being revived in 1958 in Bergamo under conductor Oliviero de Fabritiis.

As the two queens, Leyla Gencer and Shirley Verrett, set the vocal standards. Since then, the triumph of Maria Stuarda has been unstoppable.",

When a young man dreams that he drowns after a night of carnal passion, he asks a buddhist monk to translate the experience for him. The monk replies that the dream is a warning not to indulge the pleasures of the flesh to excess, but the man ignores his advice, marrying a virgin and making love to her constantly. However, after several torrid affairs, the man begins to realise the sagacity of the monk's warning.",

We're Coming to Get You!\" is a flood of images driven by a tempest of guitars. The film's creators jam 20 years of German music history into 120 minutes of film. Musicians from BLIND PASSENGERS, DIE SKEPTIKER, SANDOW and other bands explode their way through the film.  Fans of the DEFA documentary \"Flüstern und Schreien\" (\"Whisper and Shout\") already know the stars of that film, Aljoscha, Paul and Flake of the band Feeling B. Here they have a chance to see how these musicians survived the period after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the \"escalation of possibilities\" that came with it. And you're allowed to laugh, too!",

Jeff confesses to Cole's involvement, and the Range Busters, with the help of town banker Harrison, set a trap for Cole and his outlaw vigilantes.",

It was produced to mark the introduction of the new Inter-City 125 High Speed Train services between Paddington and Bristol. One of the last big budget productions, it was treated to a coat of Technicolor and a theatrical cinema release. It also marked the beginning of the slow decline of BTF which culminated in its closure. With the abandoning of support features and shorts at cinemas in the late 1970s and early 1980s, most of the unit’s films after 1978 were made primarily for internal use.",

During her Christmas break, her mother, who works as a maid in town, drops her off at a local garage, under the care of Vellapan and Chacko, the garage workers. Sitting on her designated chair, her only source of entertainment is the sounds echoing from the children playing on the ground ahead. Her zest and fascination for life is communicated through a fly and a cat that are part of her imaginative world. Her perspective of her surrounding and her acute sense of awareness is portrayed subtly through her mature and calm demeanor. In this era of urbanization where the world is fast changing, little Hasna although blind sees the world in her own unique way. She learns to accept the inevitable changes around her and makes us question the colors of the world. An open-ended journey.",
