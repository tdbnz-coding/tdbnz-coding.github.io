When a young man dreams that he drowns after a night of carnal passion, he asks a buddhist monk to translate the experience for him. The monk replies that the dream is a warning not to indulge the pleasures of the flesh to excess, but the man ignores his advice, marrying a virgin and making love to her constantly. However, after several torrid affairs, the man begins to realise the sagacity of the monk's warning.",

Part twisted entertainment, part government intimidation tactic, the Hunger Games are a nationally televised event in which “Tributes” must fight with one another until one survivor remains.  Pitted against highly-trained Tributes who have prepared for these Games their entire lives, Katniss is forced to rely upon her sharp instincts as well as the mentorship of drunken former victor Haymitch Abernathy.  If she’s ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. The world will be watching.",

Yet, even within their central territories, some areas refused to bow to the Genghisids. Kozelsk was one of them.

Now, the people of Kozelsk must face a battle against the strongest army in the world, with no hope of victory. This is a story about people facing their death. Some try to escape, others are willing to do anything to survive, but most are prepared to protect their city from the relentless storms of the Mongolian hordes.",

Taking us back to where it all began, Straight Outta Compton tells the true story of how these cultural rebels—armed only with their lyrics, swagger, bravado and raw talent—stood up to the authorities that meant to keep them down and formed the world’s most dangerous group, N.W.A.  And as they spoke the truth that no one had before and exposed life in the hood, their voice ignited a social revolution that is still reverberating today.",

The Mongolian army, under Khan Batu’s command, was known for its invisibility, destroying anyone who dared to challenge them. Yet, even within their central territories, some areas refused to bow to the Genghisids. Kozelsk was one of them. The Mongolian armies bypassed the high walls of this small town, considering that \"the skin of the wolf was not worth the risk of encountering its teeth\".However, one of the Khan’s commanders harbored a grudge against the town's citizens. Now, the people of Kozelsk must face a battle against the strongest army in the world, with no hope of victory. This is a story about people facing their death. Some try to escape, others are willing to do anything to survive, but most are prepared to protect their city from the relentless storms of the Mongolian hordes.",

Gradually, their connection grows, but when Sara wants to take their relationship to a deeper and more physical level, Martin shies away. He is hiding a deep secret. Refusing to accept his unwillingness to open up to her, Sara compels him to expose himself, and when he finally does, it turns out he is intersex, a hermaphrodite. Sara’s love remains strong, but when she unintentionally reveals Martin’s secret to her family, she discovers that her joy at the relationship has blinded her to the reality of how society deals with “freaks.”",

Directed by Jim Abrahams, the film makes fun of a variety of other films as well, from Dances with Wolves to The Fabulous Baker Boys.

Although he initially flees from the superior forces, he returns after the uprising has been suppressed and imprisons Riemenschneider. Weeks later, he is released from prison. His hands were broken, but not his steadfastness.",

Her teacher, the charismatic Hajo Rick, convicted of her murder on the basis of circumstantial evidence and witness statements, could be innocent after all! When the ambitious defence lawyer Sophia Dreyer obtains a retrial, the former investigator finds himself in trouble: Chief Inspector Kai Matzen now has to throw the certainties of the past overboard - and realize that he is more personally involved than he would like. Sophia also suspects that she can't trust anyone. And what if it was Hajo Rick after all?

      "overview": "Maxime is a hardened bachelor who takes advantage of his freedom and assumes to live without ties or children. He has finally agreed to help a couple of friends who are trying to have a child by artificial insemination, by donating sperm to speed up the procedure. His life changes the day a rather invasive brother arrives at his home, accompanied by a rather hairy ferret, and when, in the middle of a torrid evening in gallant company, this ferret bites his private parts, making him permanently sterile. Realizing that he will never be able to have children, Maxime tries to get his gift back, only to learn that it has already been used for Lisa Barrot, a famous and seductive sports journalist. Aware that she will be the mother of his only child, he decides to do everything possible to meet her and get to know her.",

Subjected to rape, torture, and humiliation, Junko had no hope of escape as the manhunt was stalled by the captors forcing her to tell her parents that she was ok. For 41 harrowing days, Junko had to endure unimaginable suffering at the hands of these four individuals. Finally, after losing in a game of mahjong solitaire, they beat her with an iron dumbbell and set on fire with lighter fluid. She died later that day from shock. In an attempt to hide their crime they buried her in cement and thus the name 'Concrete Encased High School Murder Case' was born as Japan had to confront the horrors of this crime. The perpetrators disposed the drum in a tract of reclaimed land in Koto, Tokyo.",

After proclaiming that there is no taboo subject on television, they discover a pirate document showing Étienne Moujeotte and François Léotard in a business discussion about the destinies of TF1. Question asked : would they have agreed to broadcast this document and if not, why not ? The investigation itself is objectively searching : anything can be said on TV except one thing, the more or less close collusion of journalists and the political powers. Pierre Carles gives us a sharp reflection on the scope of this \"fourth power\" that the media have become, and on the compromises of those who are its masters.",

Troilus and Cressida is a tragicomic play in which Shakespeare cynically portrays the fates of legendary Greek and Trojan heroes, but also the story of one destroyed love, and especially the image of a useless war. A pseudo-historical fresco that has perhaps never been more topical in the domestic socio-political context. What does a Trojan War look like in which the greatest icons of ancient Greece do not want to fight? A kidnapped Helen as a ridiculous pretext; a sulking and proud Achilles wallowing in a tent and refusing to fight; men who rely more on bickering backstage politics than on concrete deeds; pandering, revenge and, as befits a proper Shakespeare, blood and death.",
