Life goes on for the protagonist until Meenakshi stumbles upon in his life. An aspiring medical student, she relates Karan’s benevolence to her late mother’s. Soon after, they both become victim of the stupid cupid’s bait.  Although in love with the uncle, Karan insists that education should be her priority over romance. Besides, their love affair wreaks havoc in Meenakshi’s upper caste family, which is known for cast prejudices. With a family to resist and her education to pay attention to, Meenakshi find it tough to get along. Finally, a seamless climax tells it all as to how the couple manages to pull it off against all the odds, predominantly Meenakshi’s family.",

Whenever something \"improper\" does happen, Clara's way of handling it is simply to shove it under the carpet and ignore it completely, as if it never happened. 3 basic rules, are, of course: 1. Never marry some one \"under\" your class (Or the class you think you are). 2. Never become pregnant out of wedlock and 3. No Abortions. As one may expect, everything crumbles when her niece gives her no option, but to break at least one of those rules",

In an atomizer, he sends a quantity, accompanied by a letter, to his brother. In the hope of his putting it on the market. The brother regards it as a joke, and, while toying with the atomizer, accidentally sprays himself. Presto! he is gone, to the amazement of the messenger boy who has carried the package thither. The boy reads the letter, and at once sees the amount of fun he can get out of it, so he nips it.",

Along the way, there will be several highly stylized musical numbers, lots of genuinely humorous dialogue, and a wacky plot-twist or two, all beautifully captured on the very last of Kodak's black-and-white Plus-X film stock.",

In the mountains in the north of Burma there are valuable deposits of jade. The area forms part of Kachin State, inhabited by many ethnic groups which found themselves embroiled in the Civil War in 2010 with the Burmese government. Jade mining was halted because of the conflict. Thousands of workers, however, went to the war zone in order to dig for illegal jade. It turned the region into a no-go area and the filmmaker Midi Z, who had so far made feature films in Burma, saw no opportunity to go and film there. It was far too dangerous.  © iffr.com",

When a young man dreams that he drowns after a night of carnal passion, he asks a buddhist monk to translate the experience for him. The monk replies that the dream is a warning not to indulge the pleasures of the flesh to excess, but the man ignores his advice, marrying a virgin and making love to her constantly. However, after several torrid affairs, the man begins to realise the sagacity of the monk's warning.",

Everyone has sort of affection for him and he too is always ready to do anything for anybody in the village. The remuneration that he gets for any job somehow is never above five rupees. But he works really hard when he is terribly hungry just for the sake of this meagre amount. And he has no complaint against anybody. People even ridicule him. But he thinks only of the positive aspect of things and has no grudge against anybody.",

The fragment consists of the following scenes: Scene 1: An older and a younger man are talking in a living room. Scene 2: The young man is courting a woman and is rejected on account of another suitor. Scene 3: The older man receives a telegram about a shipwreck. The news almost drives him to take his own life. Scene 4: The two men are now standing outside a shop and seem happy again. A woman is sitting with a child on her lap, perhaps belonging to the young man and the woman he previously pursued.  The film was directed by Viggo Larsen, who, as far as we know, directed all films for Denmark’s first film company, Nordisk Films Kompagni, in the period between 1906 and 1909. Viggo Larsen also plays the young man in the film. -Stumfilm.dk",
