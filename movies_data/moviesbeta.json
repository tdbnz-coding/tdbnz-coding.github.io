However, Broeck hasn't done anything that would justify the death penalty, so Stuyvesant waits (without much patience) for Broeck to step out of line. Broeck is romancing a beautiful woman named Tina Tienhoven, whose sister Ulda happens to be dating his best friend, Ten Pin. After Stuyvesant's men toss Broeck in jail on a trumped-up charge, Stuyvesant sets his sights on winning Tina's affections.",

When a young man dreams that he drowns after a night of carnal passion, he asks a buddhist monk to translate the experience for him. The monk replies that the dream is a warning not to indulge the pleasures of the flesh to excess, but the man ignores his advice, marrying a virgin and making love to her constantly. However, after several torrid affairs, the man begins to realise the sagacity of the monk's warning.",

The lovely Reiko suffers from a condition known as “genophobia” (the fear of sexual intercourse), so she is admitted to the Tachibana Clinic for observation. Another group of doctors have the “Dream Ring” device and use it on Reiko to analyze her wildly erotic, and violent, dreams and nightmares. The clinic doctors have more sinister reasons to test this device on Reiko, however, and secretly put her under hypnosis so that the ring is activated at any time she hears the sound of a bell. Can she escape the evil doctors’ experiment and, even if she does, who is that strange person, dressed all in black, following her around?",

He made The Valiant Ones in 1975 to unfold a story of a patriotic military general and a princess who courageously fight against the invaders during the Ming dynasty. Now the remake stars Nicky Wu, who has just returned to the silver screen with the blockbuster A Battle of Wits alongside Andy Lau, and Huang Yi from the TV versions of Everlasting Regret and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Roy Cheung from Johnnie To's Exiled also plays a crucial role in the film. With Yuen Wah from Kung Fu Hustle in the supporting cast and also serving as the action choreographer, this 2006 remake promises action sequences just as stunning as in King Hu's original. Unlike the many period epics released recently, the film puts greater emphasis on the historical aspect rather than the visual effects.",

      "overview": "A beautiful and kind girl, daughter of Baba Yaga, finds a magical stone Alatyr while walking in a field. It transforms her heart into a stone and puts her under a queer curse. She is to be the evil Countess of Stones and live in a stone tower. If the greatest gem-cutter in the world brings the stone of Alatyr to life, though, she'll become the ruler of the world. The Stone Countess, now cruel and selfish, is fascinated with the idea. She starts searching for the best gem-cutters and forces them to work with Alatyr, so the magical stone would become a living thing. Neither of the gem-cutters succeeds, so she kills them. While being imprisoned in her tower, they work on a large book about the secrets of gem-cutting. Each of them edits the book, so it's later named \"the Book of Masters\".",

In search of himself, he travels to the villages of the Kherson region that were flooded to create reservoirs - somewhere under the water column is his parents' native village, a metaphor for Ukrainian culture and historical memory mutilated in the 20th century.  The man's concerns are closely related to the surrounding world: the atmosphere of the film reproduces the confusion of the entire nation: \"What will happen next, after communism and its ideology?\" In the yard, everything points to the imminent collapse of the perestroika.",

In the center of the plot is the wandering of an artist-journalist of a Kyiv newspaper. He faces a number of internal problems: how to get along in a big city, the existence of true love and finding the answer to the eternal question - \"Who am I?\" External events echo the psychological crisis of the main character. In search of himself, he travels to the villages of the Kherson region that were flooded to create reservoirs - somewhere under the water column is his parents' native village, a metaphor for Ukrainian culture and historical memory mutilated in the 20th century.  The man's concerns are closely related to the surrounding world: the atmosphere of the film reproduces the confusion of the entire nation: \"What will happen next, after communism and its ideology?\" In the yard, everything points to the imminent collapse of the perestroika.",

Annoyed by the seller's irresponsibility, she leaves a comment calling the seller a con man, and reports it to the police. Little does she know that the seller is a psychopathic serial killer who uses an online second-hand market to lure his victims. Her comment renders his hunt for a new victim all but impossible so she becomes his next target. She starts receiving obscene phone calls, countless unwanted food deliveries, and strange men knocking on her door looking for a good time.

There are other men out there waiting for her -- kinder, more considerate and eagerly available. But for Yuko, there is only the non-committal, yet torridly magnetic Yutaka. Why him?

Heavily relies on the 'Movement' album, but has a proto Temptation, which is always good to hear. The second is their appearance at the 1998 Reading Festival, which is basically a greatest hits set, but there's nothing better than a New Order greatest hits: Regret, Bizarre Love Triangle, True Faith, Temptation (again!) and, of course, Blue Monday. The Joy Division back catalogue is also given a dusting down: Isolation, Atmosphere, Heart and Soul. Then there is an interview with the original four (we miss you Gillian) which reveals them completely at ease with their legend. God bless them.",

Love fails to blossom between Shun and Kiu in HK, and Kiu starts to drink heavily. Sandy, Kiu's luscious secretary takes advantage and gets it off with him in the gym and digusts Shun in the process. Shun gets drunk and is picked up in a bar, nearly raped, and rescued then befriended by a fellow Vietnamese, a photographer, in what is clearly a setup. Turns out Sandy is behind this ruse as well, to get Shun out of the way and have Kiu all to herself. But things don't go according to anyone's plan. Will Shun give up Kiu and his money to go back to Lik ? Will Sandy hold her nerve and push ahead ? Will the guys Sandy paid to set up Shun have their way with Sandy instead ?",

The powerful shift from the ego constructs we are taught early in life by parents and society—which promote an emphasis on achievement and accumulation—are shown in contrast to a life of meaning, focused on serving and giving back. Filmed on coastal California’s spectacular Monterey Peninsula, The Shift captures every person’s mid-life longing for a more purposeful, soul-directed life.",

In addition to the third act’s funeral music, which Arturo Toscanini conducted at Puccini’s funeral in 1924, listeners may recognize the duet from the now-restored fourth act, cut by Puccini in subsequent revisions of the work: it bears more than a passing similarity to the third-act duet in Tosca.",

      "overview": "Thomas Brasch was born as a German-Jewish emigrant in England in order to move to the young GDR with his family at the beginning of the 1950s. His father Horst is primarily interested in helping to build the new German state. But Thomas prefers to realize himself as a writer and in doing so discovers his potential as a poetic rebel. His very first play was banned and soon afterwards he lost his place at the film school. When the tanks of the Soviet Union roll through the Czech capital Prague in 1968, Brasch and his girlfriend Sanda and other students try to call for protest in the streets of Berlin - and fail. His own father betrays him to the Stasi and allows Thomas to go to prison. After being paroled, he continues to try his hand at poet writing about love, revolt and death. In the GDR, however, you don't want to have anything to do with someone like him.",

Oblivious to the true value of the family heirloom, he soon learns about it from a mysterious stranger.

What Ilya doesn’t know is that the search for the lost library has been going on for centuries, and now very powerful people are after him. Ilya and the mysterious stranger decide to try their luck in finding the library.",
