The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space.

But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.",

Seated in a park bench beside Sundararajan (Gemini Ganesan), Poori asks his name and as soon as he replies, he proclaims that Sundararajan is his father.  This creates complications in Sundararajan’s life and ruins his plans of marrying his lover Latha (Savithri). The president of a hospital for the mentally ill with a not-so-mentally-strong daughter creates more problems for the hero.  After many interesting twists and turns, the truth emerges — Poori is the illegitimate child of a soldier (Mustafa) and the abandoned mother commits suicide, leaving the child behind. Sundararajan ro and Latha are so attracted to Poori that they decide to adopt him.",

When a young man dreams that he drowns after a night of carnal passion, he asks a buddhist monk to translate the experience for him. The monk replies that the dream is a warning not to indulge the pleasures of the flesh to excess, but the man ignores his advice, marrying a virgin and making love to her constantly. However, after several torrid affairs, the man begins to realise the sagacity of the monk's warning.",

To this day, Elorde holds the junior lightweight division for the longest title reign of nearly seven-and-a-half years, defending the crown he won with a spectacular 7th round knockout of Harold Gomes before 26,000 screaming fans at the inauguration of the Araneta Coliseum on March 16, 1960, 10 times against the top contenders. Elorde was the first Asian inducted into the New York-based International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1993 and was also enshrined in the World Boxing Hall of Fame. With his skills and humility both inside and outside the ring, \"Flash\" Elorde will always remain a tribute to the sport. He was a quintessential Filipino who \"feared no man but was humble before all men.\"",

To this day, Elorde holds the junior lightweight division for the longest title reign of nearly seven-and-a-half years, defending the crown he won with a spectacular 7th round knockout of Harold Gomes before 26,000 screaming fans at the inauguration of the Araneta Coliseum on March 16, 1960, 10 times against the top contenders. Elorde was the first Asian inducted into the New York-based International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1993 and was also enshrined in the World Boxing Hall of Fame. With his skills and humility both inside and outside the ring, \"Flash\" Elorde will always remain a tribute to the sport. He was a quintessential Filipino who \"feared no man but was humble before all men.\"",

After being maimed, the Princess wanders around trying to enlist help from anyone who will listen to her, but no matter whom she meets they either prove too weak to fight off the marauders or they wind up betraying her. Things take a turn for the surreal when her faithful servant girl cuts off her own arm to impersonate the Princess and dies. The Princess goes crazy until she meets handsome Carter Wong, the gentle brute of a butcher who is caring for his Buddhist nun mother. He promises his mom on her death bed he will marry the now lunatic princess. Serious kicking ensues, including sword wielding women, and some high kicking action from Mr. Carter Wong. Enjoy!",

Originally left by her parents as a baby with the promise that they'd be back for her someday, it's been a hard knock life ever since with her mean foster mom Miss Hannigan.

The budding relationship scandalizes the neighbors (not to mention Rachel's parents) and infuriates Yanush, a middle-aged shoe store owner who wants Rachel for himself. (Yanush feels he's entitled to marry Rachel since they're both Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern European origins, whereas Kazablan is a Sephardic Jew from Morocco.) The neighborhood has something else to worry about besides the antics of Kazablan and his gang: the city wants to tear down their crumbling homes. The residents pool their resources to save their houses, but the money that's collected is stolen. When he's jailed for the theft, Kazablan must find a way to clear himself.",

The budding relationship scandalizes the neighbors (not to mention Rachel's parents) and infuriates Yanush, a middle-aged shoe store owner who wants Rachel for himself. (Yanush feels he's entitled to marry Rachel since they're both Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern European origins, whereas Kazablan is a Sephardic Jew from Morocco.) The neighborhood has something else to worry about besides the antics of Kazablan and his gang: the city wants to tear down their crumbling homes. The residents pool their resources to save their houses, but the money that's collected is stolen. When he's jailed for the theft, Kazablan must find a way to clear himself.",

Werner Hinz plays Konrad, an idealistic Polish student who courts disaster for his loved ones through his constant harrangues against Russian impression. When his mother promises the authorities that Konrad will cease his protests, he is honor bound to obey her, no matter what the provocation. Drowning his disappointment in liquor, Konrad falls in love with nightclub singer Anna Sasotska (Viktoria von Ballasko). While he never achieves his political goals, Konrad at least finds happiness romantically. The climax of the film is particularly exciting, even though it is motivated by anti-Russian (and implicitly pro-Nazi) propaganda.",

Interviews with medical, legal and intelligence experts and evidence from declassified government memos document what has been called the greatest scandal in American medical ethics. Based on four years of research by Producer/Director Martha Davis, written by Oscar winning Mark Jonathan Harris, and filmed in HD by Emmy winning DP Lisa Rinzler, the film shows how the torture of detainees could not continue without the assistance of the doctors.",

No filmmaker is welcome there, because, against the background of a civil war, the jade miners enter the deserted mines illegally. With the aid of filming locals, however, Midi Z was able to compile this portrait. Getting rich quick turns out to be hard and risky work  Jade has always been a valuable commodity in Asia. In the mountains in the north of Burma there are valuable deposits of jade. The area forms part of Kachin State, inhabited by many ethnic groups which found themselves embroiled in the Civil War in 2010 with the Burmese government. Jade mining was halted because of the conflict. Thousands of workers, however, went to the war zone in order to dig for illegal jade. It turned the region into a no-go area and the filmmaker Midi Z, who had so far made feature films in Burma, saw no opportunity to go and film there. It was far too dangerous.  © iffr.com",
