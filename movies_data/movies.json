Osorgin received a terrible sentence after he, a deeply religious man, secretly brought holy gifts to the dying Archimandrite so that he could take communion before his death. The camp authorities took the Russian officer's word of honor from Osorgin not to tell his wife anything about his predetermined fate. Only on this condition did they agree to temporarily release him from the punishment cell for his last meeting with Lina. The spouses spend the precious three days allotted to them and feel happy in the most inappropriate circumstances. Osorgin says goodbye to Lina on the pier. When the ship becomes a dot on the horizon, the guards escort George back to the punishment cell, where he carefully dresses for his final journey.",

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.",

Introduced by Kitti, an ambitious film producer, and Rossi, a creative director working on a new project, Ardi expresses his disdain for local horror films, which he believes are of poor quality and rely too much on cheap jump scares.  Through interviews and interactions with his friends, including humorous moments shared while watching horror films together, Ardi's arrogance and skepticism toward the genre are evident. His friends challenge him to watch clips from some of the most terrifying horror films, hoping to make him experience fear. However, Ardi remains unimpressed by each clip shown, continuing to mock the genre's ability to frighten him.  As the film progresses, Ardi's journey becomes not just a challenge of fear but a humorous exploration of his own biases and the nature of horror in contemporary Indonesian cinema.",

One of Joel's most elusive and cunning nemeses, Griffin has followed his former pursuer to Chicago in order to play a sadistic game of cat and mouse. Taunting Joel with photographs of his intended victims and leaving his crime scenes meticulously free of clues in order to keep the police at bay, Griffin derives as much pleasure out of watching Joel react to every movement as watching his victims die. But when Griffin moves into Joel's inner circle, Joel must quickly find some way to stop him before someone close to him becomes the next one to die.",

Directed by Jim Abrahams, the film makes fun of a variety of other films as well, from Dances with Wolves to The Fabulous Baker Boys.

A charity drag show they organize to support Ukraine turns into a symbol of unity and resilience. The film is a story of self- discovery, love, hope, and the power to find joy even in the darkest of times.",

      "overview": "Ardi, a 21-year-old cinephile who prides himself on being immune to Indonesian horror films. Introduced by Kitti, an ambitious film producer, and Rossi, a creative director working on a new project, Ardi expresses his disdain for local horror films, which he believes are of poor quality and rely too much on cheap jump scares.  Through interviews and interactions with his friends, including humorous moments shared while watching horror films together, Ardi's arrogance and skepticism toward the genre are evident. His friends challenge him to watch clips from some of the most terrifying horror films, hoping to make him experience fear. However, Ardi remains unimpressed by each clip shown, continuing to mock the genre's ability to frighten him.  As the film progresses, Ardi's journey becomes not just a challenge of fear but a humorous exploration of his own biases and the nature of horror in contemporary Indonesian cinema.",

Since all her architects are either busy otherwise or too conservative in style, this ambivalent honor falls to Edifis. He is to build the palace and be covered in gold or, if not, his fate is to be eaten by crocodiles. Edifis calls upon an old friend to help him out: The fabulous Druid Getafix from Gaul, who brews a fantastic potion that gives supernatural strength. In order to help and protect the old Druid, Asterix and Obelix accompany him on his journey to Egypt. When Julius Caesar gets wind of the project succeeding, he has the building site attacked by his troops in order to win the bet and not lose face. But just like the local pirates, he hasn't counted on Asterix and Obelix.",

Angered, Tatie fires Sandrine, and while she is alone, she goes into deep depression, eventually setting the family's apartment on fire.

But this prince, Hercules, knows nothing of his real identity or his destiny. He desires only one thing: the love of Hebe, Princess of Crete, who has been promised to his own brother. When Hercules learns of his greater purpose, he must choose: to flee with his true love or to fulfill his destiny and become the true hero of his time. The story behind one of the greatest myths is revealed in this action-packed epic - a tale of love, sacrifice and the strength of the human spirit.",

What happened is a mystery that has baffled investigators and researchers for decades. It has become known as the Dyatlov Pass Incident.  When five ambitious American college students are issued a grant to return to the site of the original events, they gear up with the belief that they can uncover and document the truth of what happened to the supposedly experienced hikers. But what they find is more shocking than anything they could have imagined. Retracing the steps of the Russians' ill-fated journey, the students are plagued by strange and increasingly terrifying phenomena that suggest that in spite of the desolate surroundings, they are not alone. The forces at work in the Dyatlov Pass Incident have been waiting for them.",
