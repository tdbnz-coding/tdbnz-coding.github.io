After two years in which censorship was relaxed, in 1977 it was completely abolished, and the “S” classification was created to protect viewers from those films that could “hurt their sensitivity.” The “S” classification was granted when the content was especially violent, sexual or political, creating a mixed bag in which all types of unclassifiable films could fit. In force from 1978 to 1983, this classification turned out to be a great commercial attraction for a society that had suffered four decades of national-Catholic dictatorship and repression.",

Known as \"The Terrifying Trio,\" Linnea Quigley (The Return of the Living Dead), Brinke Stevens (The Slumber Party Massacre) and Michelle Bauer (The Tomb), headlined upwards of ten films per year, fending off men in rubber monster suits, pubescent teenage boys, and deadly showers. They joined together in campy cult films like Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-a-Rama (1988) and Nightmare Sisters (1987). They traveled all over the world, met President Reagan, and built mini-empires of trading cards, comic books, and model kits. Then it all came crashing down. This documentary remembers these actresses - and their most common collaborators - on how smart they were to play stupid",

They joined together in campy cult films like Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-a-Rama (1988) and Nightmare Sisters (1987). They traveled all over the world, met President Reagan, and built mini-empires of trading cards, comic books, and model kits. Then it all came crashing down. This documentary remembers these actresses - and their most common collaborators - on how smart they were to play stupid",

The highlights of the show included pyrotechnic effects, several stage illusions and a stuntman. True to his aim of spreading love around the world, Jackson donated the proceeds from the tour (over $100 million) to charity. On October 1, 1992, the image and sound recordings that are hotly sought after by Jackson fans around the world were also made.

When a young man dreams that he drowns after a night of carnal passion, he asks a buddhist monk to translate the experience for him. The monk replies that the dream is a warning not to indulge the pleasures of the flesh to excess, but the man ignores his advice, marrying a virgin and making love to her constantly. However, after several torrid affairs, the man begins to realise the sagacity of the monk's warning.",

However, after several torrid affairs, the man begins to realise the sagacity of the monk's warning.",

It’s the third day of shooting the low budget horror ‘Tonight They Come’ on location in the wilds of New Zealand. Director SMP is already beside himself having to work with a self-obsessed leading man and a bimbo actress when into his line of fire comes a new runner, wannabe screenwriter Wesley Pennington. Clearly an accident-prone nerd, Wesley nevertheless tries his best to fit in with the crazed cast and demented crew while falling head over heels for Susan, the set caterer. But something nasty has entered the local water supply and suddenly the zombie extras start acting like genuine members of the living dead, gore stunts looks even more authentic and actual severed limbs fly. Reel life turns real as Wesley attempts to save the day while ensuring his latest script will get made.",

They put out an ad on the net to which the well experienced Alex and Timo react. We follow Diana and Julian as they prepare for the arrival of Alex and Timo, who they have invited to their home for the weekend. Diana is nervous. As soon as she is confronted with the self-confident and ravishingly sexy Alex, her insecurity increases even more. Timo seems disinterested, a sharp contrast to the boyish excitement of Julian. But as night falls and their sexual exploration begins, we notice Timo may not be as casual as he initially seemed and Diana on the other hand contains hidden strength. And so we realize there's more to 'Swingers' than just sex. Swingers: could your relationship stand the test?",

While in Spain, Pat cannot turn away from the opportunity to score the biggest drug deal of his life. All he needs is for his Essex pals Tony and Craig to deliver the cash to Marbella to close the deal. But Craig, useless as ever, turns a simple plane trip to a massive road trip packed with trickery and danger. And Tony is more worried about making it back to England as he has promised to support his best friend Nigel Benn at the boxing match of his life. While waiting in Marbella, Pat proceeds with the violent revenge he has craved for years. Revenges are made and Tony and Carlton walk Nigel Benn out to what turns out to be one of the most tragic fights in history. But the drugs they bring back seems to be a bad batch and cause them more trouble than they have ever anticipated before.",

Gigi just wants a man who says he'll call—and does—while Alex advises her to stop waiting by the phone.

And Mary, who's found an entire network of loving, supportive men, just needs to find one who's straight.",

The film also looks back to the Pentagon Papers' case and compares it to cases since 9/11 dealing with high school students' speech and protesters marching in New York City during the 2004 Republican convention. Comment comes from a range of scholars, pundits, and advocates.",

That work, Les Contes d’Hoffmann, was based on a play that strung together a collection of stories by E. T. A. Hoffmann and cast the famed poet as the protagonist of his own tales. In this performance from the 2024–25 Live in HD season, French tenor Benjamin Bernheim stars as Hoffmann, four times unlucky in love. Alongside him as the objects of his affections, soprano Erin Morley is the high-flying automaton Olympia, mezzo-soprano Clémentine Margaine is the Venetian courtesan Giulietta, and soprano Pretty Yende is both the diva Stella and the ill-fated songstress Antonia. Bass-baritone Christian Van Horn portrays the four nefarious Villains who outwit Hoffmann at every turn, and mezzo-soprano Vasilisa Berzhanskaya is Hoffmann’s Muse and his companion Nicklausse, conducted by Marco Armiliato.",

That work, Les Contes d’Hoffmann, was based on a play that strung together a collection of stories by E. T. A. Hoffmann and cast the famed poet as the protagonist of his own tales. In this performance from the 2024–25 Live in HD season, French tenor Benjamin Bernheim stars as Hoffmann, four times unlucky in love. Alongside him as the objects of his affections, soprano Erin Morley is the high-flying automaton Olympia, mezzo-soprano Clémentine Margaine is the Venetian courtesan Giulietta, and soprano Pretty Yende is both the diva Stella and the ill-fated songstress Antonia. Bass-baritone Christian Van Horn portrays the four nefarious Villains who outwit Hoffmann at every turn, and mezzo-soprano Vasilisa Berzhanskaya is Hoffmann’s Muse and his companion Nicklausse, conducted by Marco Armiliato.",

These three days correspond to a three movement sonata - the director (Lina Chamie) is a musician, so she imprinted a musical structure to her movie, with few dialogs and poetic images. It's a movie for music lovers. Written by CeciliaWolf",

      "overview": "The hits come fast and furious in this 2001 performance by Antoine \"Fats\" Domino at the Jazz and Heritage Festival in his hometown of New Orleans. Well, maybe not that fast; Fats's style was never what you'd call exactly frenetic, and he was well into his seventies at the time of this show. But there are a whole lot of hits--\"I'm Walkin',\" \"Blueberry Hill,\" \"Walking to New Orleans,\" \"My Blue Heaven,\" etc.--and they're just as irresistible as ever, with Domino and band (including a full horn section) in top form as they deliver their brew of R&B, rock & roll, and country music with its distinctively rollicking New Orleans vibe. Aside from the 60-minute concert, the DVD features interviews with Fats, Allen Toussaint (himself a legendary New Orleans musician and producer), author/music journalist Mikal Gilmore, and others, plus a minute or two of Domino and Toussaint jamming at the piano",

Certain that the next war will herald the apocalypse, the youngster make plans to run off to a desert island and set up a new society. This, however, will require money, which is why the boys decide to pull off a \"necessary\" robbery. Idealism collapses in the face of cold reality, as the five youths suffer from the consequences of their actions. Avant le Deluge was one of a group of films cowritten by director Andre Cayatte and Charles Spaak which endeavored to explore the touchy social issues of the day: others in the Cayatte-Spaak canon include the euthanasia-themed Justice est Faite and the capital-punishment tract Nous sommes tous des assassins.",

As hard as she tries to keep it together, she finds herself in danger of jeopardizing her seemingly perfect life. It isn't until Brooke meets Jake, a handsome and charismatic stranger, that she feels like she's found someone who not only understands her, but accepts her for who she is. As tempting as it is to get swept up in the romance, she can't help but feel like something in their relationship isn't quite right. When her best friend is brutally murdered, Brooke has no choice but to depend on her new love...especially because she's worried that she might be the killer.",

But there are a whole lot of hits--\"I'm Walkin',\" \"Blueberry Hill,\" \"Walking to New Orleans,\" \"My Blue Heaven,\" etc.--and they're just as irresistible as ever, with Domino and band (including a full horn section) in top form as they deliver their brew of R&B, rock & roll, and country music with its distinctively rollicking New Orleans vibe. Aside from the 60-minute concert, the DVD features interviews with Fats, Allen Toussaint (himself a legendary New Orleans musician and producer), author/music journalist Mikal Gilmore, and others, plus a minute or two of Domino and Toussaint jamming at the piano",

He then shows how this powerful narrative, backed by billions of dollars a year and propagated by the best creative minds, has blinded us to the catastrophic costs of ever-accelerating rates of consumption.",

Women will grieve (for a short time), and then they will unite and create a new better world - with eco-towns, renewable energy, opportunities to do whatever they want, even science and biohacking, even yoga and self-development. Reproduction now occurs by artificial insemination, and only girls are born in the new world. But not everyone likes such a world order. Some of the surviving men and women loyal to them go to live in abandoned cities, begin to steal electricity, enjoying freedom and traditional sex. The tranquility of the ideally arranged female world is threatened when teacher Rada from the eco-city \"Two Hills\" meets the young \"primate\" Hera outside it.",

And in order to spend as much time with her as possible, he does his best to make sense of the mysterious codes and expectations of his weird new tribe: the Parent-Teacher Association.
