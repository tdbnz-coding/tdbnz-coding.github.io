He is to build the palace and be covered in gold or, if not, his fate is to be eaten by crocodiles. Edifis calls upon an old friend to help him out: The fabulous Druid Getafix from Gaul, who brews a fantastic potion that gives supernatural strength. In order to help and protect the old Druid, Asterix and Obelix accompany him on his journey to Egypt. When Julius Caesar gets wind of the project succeeding, he has the building site attacked by his troops in order to win the bet and not lose face.

When Maeve - a female college student - sleeps with Charlie, the married man of the host family she is staying with, both sense the deadly curse is closing in on them. Unable to get anyone to believe them, Maeve and Charlie seek out a local history student to help find answers and figure out a way to defend themselves. It all comes undone, however, as several people are horrifically killed by the savage being - one-by-one at a rapid pace. Eventually, Maeve, Charlie and the few survivors band together in an attempt to defeat the monster once and for all.",

All other heroes are equal to him, children want to be like him, and girls just look at him. Finist is a real superstar. And he carefully protects and maintains this status of his. He needs more and more feats, he is simply obsessed with them. But there is a nuance. The practical benefit of the feat for Finist is no longer of decisive importance.

But going to the end of the world, where Beauty is imprisoned in a tower, guarded by an unimaginable Beast, is a challenge.",
