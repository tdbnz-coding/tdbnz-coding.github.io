The lovely Reiko suffers from a condition known as “genophobia” (the fear of sexual intercourse), so she is admitted to the Tachibana Clinic for observation. Another group of doctors have the “Dream Ring” device and use it on Reiko to analyze her wildly erotic, and violent, dreams and nightmares. The clinic doctors have more sinister reasons to test this device on Reiko, however, and secretly put her under hypnosis so that the ring is activated at any time she hears the sound of a bell. Can she escape the evil doctors’ experiment and, even if she does, who is that strange person, dressed all in black, following her around?",

The lovely Reiko suffers from a condition known as “genophobia” (the fear of sexual intercourse), so she is admitted to the Tachibana Clinic for observation. Another group of doctors have the “Dream Ring” device and use it on Reiko to analyze her wildly erotic, and violent, dreams and nightmares. The clinic doctors have more sinister reasons to test this device on Reiko, however, and secretly put her under hypnosis so that the ring is activated at any time she hears the sound of a bell. Can she escape the evil doctors’ experiment and, even if she does, who is that strange person, dressed all in black, following her around?",

It is also the ancestor of English bourgeois comedy and gave birth to a tradition that reaches down to the modern TV sitcom.

Too often these debates have fallen into simplistic battles between those who claim that media images directly cause violence and those who argue that activists exaggerate the impact of media exposure.  Based on interviews conducted with George Gerbner before his death in 2005, the film urges us to think about media effects in more nuanced ways. In contrast to behaviorist models that see media violence as causing real-world violence, and limited effects models that question the impact of media altogether, Gerbner encourages us to move outside the frame of this debate to consider how the repetitive stories media tell constitute a pervasive cultural environment - a landscape of ritualized, often violent images that have the power to cultivate how we see and understand the world.",

When a young man dreams that he drowns after a night of carnal passion, he asks a buddhist monk to translate the experience for him. The monk replies that the dream is a warning not to indulge the pleasures of the flesh to excess, but the man ignores his advice, marrying a virgin and making love to her constantly. However, after several torrid affairs, the man begins to realise the sagacity of the monk's warning.",

Ultimo is a 90-minute black-and-white silent film, with scenes from the director's meanderings in La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain) interspersed with lines from Rizal's poem, which was written a day before the hero's execution in 1896. Waiting, ambivalence, and re-membering —themes usually tackled in literature and criticism— are investigated through a series of images: the mundane elevated to the affective through a sensibility that does not shy away from pushing the boundaries of art. This version is scored by a post-kundiman duet of guitar and banduria.",

According to the United Nations, 963 million people - almost one in six inhabitants of our planet - are seriously malnourished. At present, the right to food is surely, of all human rights, the one that is violated with the most impunity. Jean Ziegler argues that hunger is caused by human injustice and assures that today the world could produce enough food to feed the world's population. Among the main causes of this disaster, Ziegler points to stock market speculation, which forces cereal prices to rise, and the appearance of biofuels as a new source of energy. Burning food to keep millions of cars on the roads is a crime against humanity. Hunger is no inescapable destiny. A starving child is killed. The current world order of globalized financial capitalism is not only deadly, it is also absurd. Whoever speculates on staple foods kills children.",

What's behind the mysterious arrival of this apex predator in an area where it's rarely been seen for hundreds of years? Are deadly encounters with tourists inevitable? To separate fact from fear, NOVA teams with leading shark experts in Australia and the United States to uncover the science behind the great white's hunting instincts. With shark populations plummeting, scientists race to unlock the secrets of these powerful creatures of the deep in their quest to save people -- and sharks.",

In the film, he works at the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw. Some of the people begin to argue about the queue order: Piotr Fronczewski (actor), Marek Piwowski (director), Władysław Komar (athlete, actor). Himilsbach wakes up and talks about his gold rush dream with Jack London and Martin Eden. More people join the bar where he waits for 1 p.m. (alcohol is sold then). They ask him for a loan, Zbigniew Buczkowski (actor) is one of them. On the set, Himilsbach is asked to act consciously, however, he is mainly interested in the amount of his fee. Surprisingly enough, he talks about actors and their mission during a meeting with young people in the park. In his dreams, the man sees himself as a seductive satire (colored part). At the very end of the day, the protagonist performs in a cabaret group.",

Waiting, ambivalence, and re-membering —themes usually tackled in literature and criticism— are investigated through a series of images: the mundane elevated to the affective through a sensibility that does not shy away from pushing the boundaries of art. This version is scored by a post-kundiman duet of guitar and banduria.",

It's her style - seen best in her roles as a wife of charm and independence - that's captured and celebrated here.",

Chaos is reigning in the labyrinth of passages and halls of the former monastery where the library is housed. In order to save space the director of the library has introduced a peculiar system. The books are arranged in the bookcases according to height and six girls dressed in black, the library assistants, are quite happy to cut volumes down to size in case of need. Boruvka refuses the case, since he is specialist in murders. He has to return to the investigation, however, when senior lecturer Zajíc disappears.",

That is why Ota decides that this is the time to look up Jana, the retired actress who had influenced the course of his life many years ago. However, his reunion with Jana - who lives in a retirement home - works out differently to his expectations. Although disappointed at first, it is actually this zestful lady who sets Ota in the right direction again.

Ellie Kendrick, a truly youthful Juliet, and Adetomiwa Edun, a boyish Romeo, head an excellent cast whose period costumes point to the timelessness of parental disapproval, adolescent temperament, rivalry and violence. Filmed before a live audience at Shakespeare’s Globe in the heart of London, its intimate and atmospheric setting adds immediacy and vitality to the humour and passion of Shakespeare’s verse.

It also has a DVD and Blu ray counterpart, but we'll be focusing on the cd version here.  The disc opens with four tracks from Axel's first band STEELER with opener \"Call Her Princess\" being the highlight. This is nuts and bolts 80's German steel with speedy riffs and chunky drums. Pell's later material played here after he went solo like \"Nasty Reputation\" and \"Warrior\" tends to get more melodic and ornate in line with a vintage RAINBOW sound. The remainder of the first disc focuses on the first part of Axel's career with vocalists Rob Rock and Jeff Scott Soto making guest appearances.",

And so KINORAMA - Beyond the Walls of Cinema was born, a stand-alone continuation of The Amazing Spectator that looks at cinema’s future in cyberspace and, accordingly, perhaps the end of its enslavement to figurative representation, the 'stupid sacred in narrative cinema' (to use a Pêra’ism), realism and artificiality in 3D cinema, and many other aspects.",

Staged by Marco Arturo Marelli, who sets it in a modern-day mining village, with the feel of a gritty modern drama, during the American gold rush of 1849. An unlikely setting for an Italian opera, but one that has a happy ending. It tells the tale of Minnie, the bartender in the saloon whom all the local men adore, and Dick Johnson alias Ramerrez, a notorious bandit. Dick and Minnie fall in love on first meeting, so much so that he vows to change his life as a bandit, sung by two contemporary great singers: Nina Stemme and Jonas Kaufmann. A new production from Marco Arturo Marelli brought one of Puccini’s rarely performed works to the Vienna State Opera stage in September 2013. Jonas Kaufmann in his role debut as the wanted and notorious bandit Ramerrez proves ideally cast, full of power, with his breathtakingly beautiful baritone timbre.",

She was sexually attacked and had no memory of it, until photographic evidence spread through social media. The resulting humiliation and bullying the Nova Scotia teen received led to her tragic suicide less than two years later. News of her death reverberated worldwide, a stunning demonstration of the power of images and social networks to amplify the extent of rape culture and effects of depression. Now, her parents and those who knew her reassemble the pieces of Parsons’s life in their courageous quest to make accountable the systems that failed to protect her. With the support of Anonymous, an online campaign and public pressure, they forced the Nova Scotian government and RCMP to address the case and bring the perpetrators to justice. Parsons’s story epitomizes the immense capacity of new tools in these nascent years of social networking.",

Said was a member of the Palestine National Council. After resigning from the PNC in 1991, Said wrote critically about the post-Oslo peace process, the political failures of Yasser Arafat and the PLO.  Said was diagnosed with leukemia in 1991 and struggled with the disease while continuing to write and teach. He stopped giving interviews but made an exception less than a year before his death in 2003, speaking about his illness, work, Palestine, politics, life, and education. The last interview is the final testament of this passionately committed intellectual.",

Upon learning that these two monks wish to meet Brama Kumbara (Fendy Pradana), Lasmini thinks she has found a way to take revenge. These two monks first meet up with Lasmini’s students in Jawadwipa.

Then Mantili (Elly Ermawatie) also becomes angry. However, Lasmini cannot be found. She disappeared after losing the battle. Brama then accepts a challenge by the two monks to test his martial arts skills against theirs. They battle for three days and nights, but nobody wins.",

For many, the South Pacific is synonymous with paradise sun, beaches and of course, the bikini. But the bikini, or rather the island Bikini, also stands for a disastrous series of nuclear tests, carried out by the USA immediately after the Second World War. To this end, numerous ships of different sizes and categories were brought together.

Chandu sets out in pursuit with his sister Dorothy, niece Betty and nephew Bob; but, shipwrecked on the magic island, Chandu finds his family also held prisoner for sacrifice while he is plunged into an endless maze of caverns beneath the evil temple, where both his mortal and magical strength seem rendered useless.",

Mozart was commissioned by Gottfried van Swieten to modernise the score fifty years after Handel’s popular composition (1742), mainly by arranging the wind parts and partially re-composing them.  With Marc Minkowski a conductor has been engaged who understands perfectly how to combine baroque style with the tonal possibilities of an orchestra of the classical period like the Musiciens du Louvre. The excellent soloist quartet with Elena Tsallagova, Wiebke Lehmkuhl, Richard Croft and José Coca Loza merges perfectly into Wilson’s enormous flood of images.",

The parrot spots Sylvester, foraging through the trash. Telling the cat he needs more vitamins (which the canary has been swallowing in bulk), he lures the cat inside to snare the canary. The straightforward approach fails (the canary bops him in the nose). He carves a female canary from soap, lures Frankie there; the birds slide down a greased counter, into the sink, and down the drain, but only the soap bird goes through the pipe and down Sylvester's throat. A trail of birdseed into the garage seems to work, but Frankie jacks Sylvester's mouth open. Sylvester laces the vitamins with buckshot; like all cartoon magnets, his attracts everything metal in sight except his prey.",

These sketches are inadequately performed, and can easily be ignored. Ce Siecle a 50 Ans both preserved and provided celluloid material for scores of future documentaries.",

A live recording captured on 7th November 2022 at Amsterdam’s 17,000 capacity Ziggo Dome, it places the listener/viewer right at the heart of the stage for the duration of the show as psychotropic visuals explode behind the band as they play a superlative set of songs that features - to use Steven Wilson’s words - “no hits”, where each one is received like an anthem from an alternate universe.  Closure/Continuation Live includes live recordings of much of their 2022 reunion album (including the singles Harridan and Of The New Day) as well as classic tracks like Trains, Fear of a Blank Planet and Anesthetize.",

The ensuing tour spawned the live album, Hell Freezes Over, which debuted at number one on the Billboard album chart. It included four new studio songs, with 'Get Over It' and 'Love Will Keep Us Alive' both becoming Top 40 hits. The album - for which the live tracks were recorded at an MTV Special on April 24, 1994 - proved as successful as the tour, selling six million copies in the U.S. The following night - April 25, 1994 - the Eagles returned to Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank, CA, where they had recorded the previous night, and a second show was filmed and indeed transmitted on television. For the first time on vinyl, this release features this relaxed and quite extraordinary event in its entirety. Captured across two installments, this delightful and rare performance will prove a must have item for Eagles fans everywhere.",

Before the year was out, an extraordinary opportunity arose: to stage Turandot in its original setting in the Forbidden City of Beijing. The outdoor production was an undertaking on an epic scale. A fascinating chronicle of an unprecedented cross-cultural collaboration, THE TURANDOT PROJECT combines the pageantry of this opulent opera production with a spectacular cinematic portrait of the struggles and triumphs of Zubin Mehta and Zhang Yimou to mount their production in this most historic venue of China.

A 1971 visit to a Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) training camp while on the way back from Cannes resulted in Adachi's most infamous film, the agit-prop documentary Red Army/PFLP: Declaration of World War, which he co-directed with Wakamatsu. Soon after, Adachi joined a splinter cell of the Japanese Red Army in Lebanon, where he stayed from 1974 until he was deported to Japan in 1997 to serve time for passport violations.",

Whether you’re a regular who thinks of the bar as “Cheers for Queers” or a passerby, this snappy locally-produced documentary is chock-full of familiar faces and fascinating stories. Deeply personal interviews provide a history of this lesbian-owned bar as well as the Castro area—a blue collar Irish-Italian community in the ‘60s that became a gay mecca in the ‘70s, endured the health crisis of the ‘80s, and has served as a sense of home, family, and emotional nourishment for so many in our community every day of its 47-year history.",

In the documentary, he talks about the personal and socio-political contexts of his life and confesses in it his admiring relationship with Vysočina, which is for him an \"anchor in his soul\". The viewer learns what the former prime minister thinks about and how he reflects on the recent past, and in this way he can actually learn something about himself, because Miloš Zeman is one of the most powerful men in our modern history and therefore also, in a certain sense, the embodiment of Czech society.",

Eager to get to know the new pastor, Miss Pat, the church's controlling widow-woman, invites Evan and Nora to stay with her while she has the parsonage renovated. Left alone at Miss Pat's beautiful home in the mountains of North Georgia, Nora begins to suspect that Miss Pat's extremely sheltered adult son, Elijah, may have had something to do with the previous pastor's death.

Owing more to Psycho and Misery than Left Behind, Dangerous Calling is sure to keep you on the edge of the pew. In this church the politics can be deadly.",

The mechanism is unusual: a director makes a short and sends it to the next director, who in turn makes his own short for the purpose of plagiarizing the one he received. And so the chain of plagiarism continues until it reaches the last one. Each one interprets in their own way what it means to plagiarize the received film. The first link in the chain is James Benning, one of the world's most patient filmmakers. His extensive plans are replicated in the following fragments. Disobedience moves the exercise away from literality and an exploration of the texture of the images begins. In its repetitive mechanism, we can see that cinema is, in addition to record of  reality, an art of images and sound. (Santiago González Cragnolino)",

During their weekly ritual, they discover that Saturn has turned, which mostly means much mayhem and doom. They are proven right, when Argentina’s president storms in and asks Jorge and Alberto to save her daughter from the clutches of Judge Fayo, a man who wants to achieve the triumph of neoliberalism. During their search for the girl, Jorge and Alberto will have to deal with demons from another dimension. And that all before midnight! Time to dust off their magic tricks, because the fate of the world is at stake!",
