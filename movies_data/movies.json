To carry out the investigation, Jodie must rely on her father Mark and an unlikely ally: Matt, a hacker with a criminal past.

But, to begin with, they were scorned, penniless outsiders. 1874 was the year that changed everything; the first Impressionists, “hungry for independence”, broke the mould by holding their own exhibition outside official channels. Impressionism was born and the art world was changed forever.  What led to that first groundbreaking show 150 years ago? Who were the maverick personalities that wielded their brushes in such a radical and provocative way? The spectacular Musée d’Orsay exhibition brings fresh eyes to this extraordinary tale of passion and rebellion. The story is told not by historians and curators but in the words of those who witnessed the dawn of Impressionism: the artists, press and people of Paris, 1874.",

We discover his influence on the island's music, poetry, dramatic scene and current narrative, as no other poet in the world has been as acclaimed, read and performed in Cuba as he has been. He is a legend in Cuba and, for this reason, Cuban writer Martínez Carmenate points out that his presence on the island is a phenomenon of atmosphere and underground roots, but, above all, Federico was immensely happy there.",

To appease the angry mountain gods, the famous Nepalese mountaineer and national hero, Mingma Tsiri Sherpa, risks everything to return to Mount Everest one last time to retrieve a body and appease the sacred mountain.",

Osorgin received a terrible sentence after he, a deeply religious man, secretly brought holy gifts to the dying Archimandrite so that he could take communion before his death. The camp authorities took the Russian officer's word of honor from Osorgin not to tell his wife anything about his predetermined fate. Only on this condition did they agree to temporarily release him from the punishment cell for his last meeting with Lina. The spouses spend the precious three days allotted to them and feel happy in the most inappropriate circumstances. Osorgin says goodbye to Lina on the pier. When the ship becomes a dot on the horizon, the guards escort George back to the punishment cell, where he carefully dresses for his final journey.",

One of Joel's most elusive and cunning nemeses, Griffin has followed his former pursuer to Chicago in order to play a sadistic game of cat and mouse. Taunting Joel with photographs of his intended victims and leaving his crime scenes meticulously free of clues in order to keep the police at bay, Griffin derives as much pleasure out of watching Joel react to every movement as watching his victims die. But when Griffin moves into Joel's inner circle, Joel must quickly find some way to stop him before someone close to him becomes the next one to die.",

As Enzo persuades a reluctant Jacques to compete against him in a free diving contest -- determining who can dive deeper and longer without scuba gear -- Jacques meets Johana, a beautiful insurance investigator from America, and he finds that he must choose between his love for her and his love of the sea.",

These complexities unfold through a delicate interplay of fragmented images, archival material, and evocative soundscapes. Schedelbauer’s distinct formal approach, a meticulous choreography of light, texture, and rhythm, invites the viewer into the layered emotional terrain of their relationship, which, like personal history and cultural identity, is shaped by time and memory.",

In the fictional town of Navkot, a father and daughter, Ardaas and Baani, wait for the return of Harman, their wife, and mother, whilst clinging onto hope through letters and a simple recipe that carries memories of home.  But this is no ordinary story. Told through the voice of Laqeer, a personified boundary burdened by the weight of separation, the film explores the quiet aftermath of the Partition- not just the displacement, but the lingering absence, the unanswered letters, the daunting secrets, and the wounds that time cannot heal.  With poetry, music, and unforgettable characters, Gajar Ka Halwa is a poignant reflection on love that lingers- warm, wistful, and bittersweet, just like the first bite of something once familiar yet forever changed.",

Except that here they are stuck in a car together for over 500 miles. It's going to be a long journey. Boris, Elie and Maxime, three men, three generations, no affinity.

He is to build the palace and be covered in gold or, if not, his fate is to be eaten by crocodiles. Edifis calls upon an old friend to help him out: The fabulous Druid Getafix from Gaul, who brews a fantastic potion that gives supernatural strength. In order to help and protect the old Druid, Asterix and Obelix accompany him on his journey to Egypt. When Julius Caesar gets wind of the project succeeding, he has the building site attacked by his troops in order to win the bet and not lose face. But just like the local pirates, he hasn't counted on Asterix and Obelix.",

He plays Topper Harley, a fighter pilot with an axe to grind: clearing the family name. He gets involved in a relationship with Valerie Golino, a woman with an unusually talented stomach. But his mission is to avenge his father. Lloyd Bridges, late in his career, revealed an aptitude for this kind of silliness, here as a commander who is both incredibly dim and delightfully accident prone. Directed by Jim Abrahams, the film makes fun of a variety of other films as well, from Dances with Wolves to The Fabulous Baker Boys. It was so successful that they all returned in the sequel, Hot Shots! Part Deux.",

After spending 2 years and millions of dollars, the massive undertaking eventually fell apart, but the artists Jodorowsky assembled for the legendary project continued to work together. This group of artists, or his “warriors” as Jodorowsky named them, went on to define modern sci-fi cinema with such films as Alien, Blade Runner, Star Wars and Total Recall.",

Rather than featuring one continuous narrative, the film expresses the influence of fandom and innocence through a collection of short films about Jackson, some of which are long-form music videos from Jackson's 1987 album Bad. The film is named after his famous dance, \"the moonwalk\", which he originally learned as \"the backslide\" but perfected the dance into something no one had seen before. The movie's introduction is a type of music video for Jackson's \"Man in the Mirror\" but is not the official video for the song. The film then expresses a montage of Michael's career, which leads into a parody of his Bad video titled \"Badder\", followed by sections \"Speed Demon\" and \"Leave Me Alone\". What follows is the biggest section where Michael plays a hero with magical powers and saves three children from Mr. Big. This section is \"Smooth Criminal\" which leads into a performance of \"Come Together\".",

When the agent snaps from the strain in front of the First Lady, a new agent is assigned to Luke.
