He becomes addicted to the dream and falls in love with the beautiful female student in it. Unfortunately, the dream is part of the Monk's conspiracy to obtain or destroy all that matters to him. Once Wong finally finishes his dream, things start going horribly badly. For example, his dog loses its head and his mother gets mutilated and stuffed into a box while he was asleep. The dream maker has gained control of Wong through his dreams and his desires and is out to take everything from him. In an attempt to seek revenge, his brother returns from Malaysia and joins forces with the Monk's wife, who has grown tired of the ritual abuse delivered by her sadistic husband.",

Directed by Jim Abrahams, the film makes fun of a variety of other films as well, from Dances with Wolves to The Fabulous Baker Boys.

The pop-star get's hers when Rapeman shows her that she ain't always the boss. From there the story shifts gears when a Senator's secretary seeks out Rapeman's services to rape his fiancé who has been brainwashed by a local cult. According to the by-laws of the cult - if the woman has sex with a non-member, then she will be disassociated from the cult, thus bringing the wife back to her husband. This back-fires when the cult does not ex-communicate her - so Keisuke and Uncle infiltrate the cult to get to the bottom of their shady dealings. The resulting investigation embroils the duo in a conspiracy between the cult and a sleazy politician that can only be \"righted through penetration\"...",

When Athena rebels against Abel's plan, he attacks her, sending her soul to Elysion, the final resting place from which there is no return.

The most popular application for the Augma is the game Ordinal Scale, which immerses players in a fantasy role-playing game with player rankings and rewards.

Despite being grown up, Timmy finds a loophole in the fairy rulebook Da Rules: if he continues to act like a kid, he will still get to keep his fairies. However, the dilemma rises when Tootie, who was once a dorky girl when she was 10 years old, returns to Dimmsdale as an attractive woman. Timmy falls in love with her, a sign that he is growing up to an adult, which means he is closer to losing his fairies. Meanwhile, an oil business tycoon named Hugh J. Magnate, Jr., who teams up with Mr. Crocker, plans to use Timmy's fairies' magic in order to promote his oil business.",
