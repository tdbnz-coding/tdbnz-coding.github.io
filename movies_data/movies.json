The way they raise funds (selling pieces of the \"historic\" wall) and struggle against the heartless machinery of bureaucracy forms the axis of the film. In their efforts, the four protagonists are assisted by Regina, a translator familiar with local customs and practices. The film deals with the problems of artists in the new, commercializing reality. It is the story of strangers, auslanders who want to realize their dreams and ambitions outside their homeland. It raises topical issues of chauvinism, xenophobia and hatred of foreigners felt by both Germans and Poles.",

In spite of everything, Maury wants his girl back, and Sam agrees to a divorce on the stipulation that Maury cast him as the star in his next show. Once again, Maury reneges and, before Sam can exact his revenge, Uncle Sam comes to the rescue and he is drafted into the army.",

Now her dream is to get to the most important dance competition in the country and, of course, win. Varya meets Nik, a famous dancer and blogger. A friendship develops between the guys, and they decide to compete at the competition together. But Nik's wealthy and influential mother does not accept her son's choice, which deprives the boys of important financial support. Varya and Nik will have to find adult solutions on their own to follow their dreams. Their \"team\" on this journey will be Varya's dad, Toshka, the girl's smart friend, and Pegasus, a charismatic street dancer. They are all united by faith in victory, hope that the impossible is possible and, of course, a love of dancing. It is she who pushes young dancers to answer the main question for them: \"Can I dance better than myself?\"",

Surgery has left him seeking treatment for impotence, but Effi insists she’s content with their emotional closeness. In her work as a physical therapist, though, Effi sees the link between body and heart every day. The biggest challenge to their loving relationship has been the gambling debts Sassi’s adult son keeps running up. But the couple’s fragile understanding, compounded by the presence of two young men, introduces new threats. Their teenage grandson, Omri, returns from living with his father in Europe, at loose ends and clearly in need of guidance. For one thing, he can barely stand to wear a shirt. Then a young patient turns up at the swimming pool where Effi conducts therapy sessions. He comes to confront her about something from their past, something complicated, contested, and painful to them both.",

According to tradition, the two see each other at least once a year for a weekend of sailing. But this year Pietschi drops out without leaving a message, and simply disappears. Gregor’s life goes on, but he is confused and searches everywhere for a sign of his brother’s whereabouts. The more Gregor realises how little he knows about his brother, the more he becomes fascinated by these things he doesn't know. And the longer Pietschi remains missing, the more obsessed Gregor becomes with his brother’s fading echo, even going so far as to try and slip into his brother’s life. But what happens when one of them suddenly disappears from the mirror image? Can the other continue to be the person they are. Or rather, were?",

When he wanted her too much, an extract of wormwood, comfrey and anise, slightly sharpened with brandy, was slipped to the young man. The marriage recipes were simple at first glance and apparently very effective, judging by the punishments of those who secretly engaged in witchcraft alchemy. Even three hundred years ago, association with unclean forces and possession by the devil meant being sent to the stockade or sentenced to death by burning. This was exactly the fate that befell Magdalena, the parish cook, and Marta, the widow of a wigmaker. As witches, they were condemned to have their souls wander forever without consolation. Three hundred and thirteen years later, Magdalene and Martina's souls managed to \"incarnate\" into the bodies of two modern women.",

Osorgin received a terrible sentence after he, a deeply religious man, secretly brought holy gifts to the dying Archimandrite so that he could take communion before his death. The camp authorities took the Russian officer's word of honor from Osorgin not to tell his wife anything about his predetermined fate. Only on this condition did they agree to temporarily release him from the punishment cell for his last meeting with Lina. The spouses spend the precious three days allotted to them and feel happy in the most inappropriate circumstances. Osorgin says goodbye to Lina on the pier. When the ship becomes a dot on the horizon, the guards escort George back to the punishment cell, where he carefully dresses for his final journey.",

      "overview": "Over twenty-five years after his death in July 1989, the controversial Austrian conductor Herbert von Karajan remains an enigma. He was the most successful conductor in the history of classical music. Many of his recordings - of Italian opera, of Wagner and Richard Strauss, of Sibelius, Beethoven and Brahms - are treasured by music lovers around the world. Yet, even at the peak of his fame, his performances were variously criticised for being too opulent, too manicured, lacking warmth or spiritual depth.  This musical profile explores the many paradoxes in the life and music of this controversial figure, who forged his international reputation in London with the Philharmonia Orchestra shortly after the end of the Second World War and went on to reign supreme in the classical music world during his three decades with the Berlin Philharmonic. The film also examines Karajan's belief in the visual power of music, and his determination to leave behind a substantial legacy of music on film.",

I live even in the world's happiest country, Denmark! I have all the pieces to be for. I just do not know if I'm happy. For a house also means also debt and concerns that a dog does chores and to take the piss on the floor, a girlfriend means expectations and compromises, a daughter means responsibilities - and sometimes to take the piss on the floor, AND we must not forget that Denmark thus also one of the countries with the highest suicide rate. Let me put it another way: Do I be happy? \"  The question put Christian Fuhlendorff himself in his third one-man show \"To make a short story long,\" which premiered at Bremen Theatre in Copenhagen 19 September 2014. In its previous shows, he took the audience on a journey into in his quirky and comedic universe. This time is no exception.",

Shocked by Christ’s unexpected offer, Judas decides to join the apostles, if only to figure out what is going on. He gradually starts to comprehend Christ’s message, but feels that the apostles are blindly following their teacher. Judas argues with them, and tries to defend his right to divine the truth of God. But when he fails to make them understand, he realizes that Christ’s teachings may sink into oblivion without benefiting humanity. His solution is to betray Christ. “By killing a man, have I not saved a God?”",
