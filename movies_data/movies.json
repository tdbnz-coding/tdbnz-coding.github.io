Li Quan, the \"leader of black religion\", has not given up trying to find Ying Feng, but his search is greatly slowed down by his assistants being far more interested in screwing each other silly than revenge.

The film was only screened in the US for the first time at a \"Monster Bash\" convention in 2014. Comments from the attendees included the fact that the film was somewhat illogical, and had more emphasis on comedy and romance than horror, but that it offered \"memorable glimpses of human-animal hybrids\".",

Renowned for his boxing skills, speed and ability to slip punches, the famed southpaw became an oriental champion at all weights from bantamweight to lightweight. To this day, Elorde holds the junior lightweight division for the longest title reign of nearly seven-and-a-half years, defending the crown he won with a spectacular 7th round knockout of Harold Gomes before 26,000 screaming fans at the inauguration of the Araneta Coliseum on March 16, 1960, 10 times against the top contenders. Elorde was the first Asian inducted into the New York-based International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1993 and was also enshrined in the World Boxing Hall of Fame. With his skills and humility both inside and outside the ring, \"Flash\" Elorde will always remain a tribute to the sport. He was a quintessential Filipino who \"feared no man but was humble before all men.\"",

With the help of two street performers (the deft and agile Chen Kuan-tai and Shih Szu) he once helped, Tsung hatches a plot to save his beloved – with deadly consequences.",

When a desperate act to obtain leaked exam papers ends in disgrace, Narashimaachari vows to restore his honor and prepare his son honestly. But tragedy strikes on the day of the exam, plunging the family into grief. A year later, a fugitive thief named Anand—who looks exactly like the late Varadhukutty—takes refuge in their home. Asked to impersonate the dead son to comfort his mentally ill mother, Anand slowly transforms under the family's care. When the truth about the past emerges, the fragile bonds they’ve rebuilt are put to the test.",

Giora spends time with his army buddies, recalling their experiences during the War in Lebanon. His father is undergoing a major life crisis and finds both the loneliness of the city and his son's lifestyle unappealing. As a non-Jew in a Jewish society, he feels estranged, an outsider who has never been able to adapt, and contemplates suicide. Eventually, Giora's parents decide to attempt a reconciliation, until tragedy strikes.",

Dean Martin is on hand as Maury, an aspiring director also trying to claw his way up the ladder of success. When Maury gets his big break, Sam wants a part in his show, but when Maury, who is unwilling to cast Sam in the production, turns down Sam's request, Sam seduces and marries Maury's girlfriend (Shirley MacLaine). In spite of everything, Maury wants his girl back, and Sam agrees to a divorce on the stipulation that Maury cast him as the star in his next show. Once again, Maury reneges and, before Sam can exact his revenge, Uncle Sam comes to the rescue and he is drafted into the army.",

      "overview": "Vini and Mani are sisters who belong to an orthodox family which values conformity over independence. Their family and surroundings are a constant reminder of what their place and aim in life should be. While Vini, born with an intellect and desire to work towards her goals, finds her way by accepting these limitations, Mani refuses to lead a predestined life. She rebels against traditions and charts her own path. Mani's struggle to find her place under the sun brings her in direct conflict with the rigid society. Armed with boundless energy and a burning desire to make her own mark in this world, she crosses all hurdles, but fame proves expensive. While her sister is applauded, Mani is scorned. She finds herself at the pinnacle of glory, alone without her father's pride or a pat on the back. As pressures mounts, it seems her family might disintegrate.",

Cameras follow him behind the scenes—in moments private and public, funny and poignant—as he pursues the empowering notion that while the stakes have never been higher, the perils of climate change can be overcome with human ingenuity and passion.",

When his mother promises the authorities that Konrad will cease his protests, he is honor bound to obey her, no matter what the provocation. Drowning his disappointment in liquor, Konrad falls in love with nightclub singer Anna Sasotska (Viktoria von Ballasko). While he never achieves his political goals, Konrad at least finds happiness romantically. The climax of the film is particularly exciting, even though it is motivated by anti-Russian (and implicitly pro-Nazi) propaganda.",

      "overview": "Over twenty-five years after his death in July 1989, the controversial Austrian conductor Herbert von Karajan remains an enigma. He was the most successful conductor in the history of classical music. Many of his recordings - of Italian opera, of Wagner and Richard Strauss, of Sibelius, Beethoven and Brahms - are treasured by music lovers around the world. Yet, even at the peak of his fame, his performances were variously criticised for being too opulent, too manicured, lacking warmth or spiritual depth.  This musical profile explores the many paradoxes in the life and music of this controversial figure, who forged his international reputation in London with the Philharmonia Orchestra shortly after the end of the Second World War and went on to reign supreme in the classical music world during his three decades with the Berlin Philharmonic. The film also examines Karajan's belief in the visual power of music, and his determination to leave behind a substantial legacy of music on film.",

But without sex bomb Amy Yip, coarse humour or lesbian love affairs, Yu Pui Tsuen had to rely on the nudity and sex from his cast of relative unknowns to save the day.  When a young man dreams that he drowns after a night of carnal passion, he asks a buddhist monk to translate the experience for him. The monk replies that the dream is a warning not to indulge the pleasures of the flesh to excess, but the man ignores his advice, marrying a virgin and making love to her constantly. However, after several torrid affairs, the man begins to realise the sagacity of the monk's warning.",

Interviews with medical, legal and intelligence experts and evidence from declassified government memos document what has been called the greatest scandal in American medical ethics. Based on four years of research by Producer/Director Martha Davis, written by Oscar winning Mark Jonathan Harris, and filmed in HD by Emmy winning DP Lisa Rinzler, the film shows how the torture of detainees could not continue without the assistance of the doctors.",

In a dark forest, they meet Zhyelyeenee Drovosyek, a rusted iron woodchopper who wants a heart, and joins them on their quest. Bastinda sends an array of hazards, including an impish Ogre, knife wielding tigers, and winged monkeys to get the shoes from her. The monkeys are successful, and bring her to the castle.

The budding relationship scandalizes the neighbors (not to mention Rachel's parents) and infuriates Yanush, a middle-aged shoe store owner who wants Rachel for himself. (Yanush feels he's entitled to marry Rachel since they're both Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern European origins, whereas Kazablan is a Sephardic Jew from Morocco.) The neighborhood has something else to worry about besides the antics of Kazablan and his gang: the city wants to tear down their crumbling homes. The residents pool their resources to save their houses, but the money that's collected is stolen. When he's jailed for the theft, Kazablan must find a way to clear himself.",
