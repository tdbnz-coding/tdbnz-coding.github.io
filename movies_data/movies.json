But then came another surprise - a Black American who was determined on proposing to her. A Russian member of the State Duma, a Jewish teacher and an Armenian restaurateur decided they cannot possibly let her leave for the United States.

And it is only in the end that she sees: men who are special do exist - but you have to look carefully…",

He interviews many of the game’s great champions and more than a few colorful characters, who are asked the question, “What is the spirit of golf?” We hear from Arnold Palmer, Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Johnny Miller, the wonderfully unique Moe Norman, Kathy Whitworth and Nancy Lopez, and notable teachers such as David Leadbetter, “Butch” Harmon and commentators Herbert Warren Wind, Jack Whitaker, and Jim Nantz. All the answers are marvelously diverse, funny, and poetic… just like the game itself.",

What begins as a stop filled with hope for them, this \"Luxury Hotel,\" eventually becomes a limbo where they are trapped. No matter how much they flee, they may never truly escape their otherness.

This turning point helped save the Party, the Red Army, and the revolution itself.  The film is structured into five key segments: The Great Retreat from the Soviet Base, The Bloody Battle at the Xiang River, Zunyi at Dawn, Crossing the Dadu River, and The Triumphant Meeting in Northern Shaanxi. In the dramatic Dadu River crossing scene, 17 Red Army soldiers brave the treacherous current, with two tragically falling into the river—highlighting the courage and sacrifice that defined this historic journey.",

Erik has a boyfriend but a chance encounter with the semi-criminal Lyokha awakens passion of a whole new caliber in him.",

For 40 years, the CCC has saved thousands of lives from the grips of addiction and alcoholism from its humble perch on 18th Street, one block from Castro Street. Meet Me at the Club captures the history of early trans experiences, the role that the AIDS epidemic played in addiction and alcoholism, and the miraculous recoveries from hopeless states of mind and body in San Francisco. When 295 people die every day from overdoses, the story of how this beautiful community came together to survive and thrive, there's no more important time than now to tell this story.",

Osorgin received a terrible sentence after he, a deeply religious man, secretly brought holy gifts to the dying Archimandrite so that he could take communion before his death. The camp authorities took the Russian officer's word of honor from Osorgin not to tell his wife anything about his predetermined fate. Only on this condition did they agree to temporarily release him from the punishment cell for his last meeting with Lina. The spouses spend the precious three days allotted to them and feel happy in the most inappropriate circumstances. Osorgin says goodbye to Lina on the pier. When the ship becomes a dot on the horizon, the guards escort George back to the punishment cell, where he carefully dresses for his final journey.",

One day, after a family quarrel, Pavel takes Marina to their country house where she discovers that Oleg has a lover - Anastasia.

When Marie Fredriksson was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2002, it seemed like the Roxette saga had reached its tragic end. But Marie got well against all odds, and during 2009 and 2010 the group step by step laid the ground for a comeback that again created modern music history. In February 2011 Roxette kicked off their return to the world's stages with a tour that soon was dubbed \"The Never Ending Tour\", since the bookings never ceased to drop in. The world hadn't forgotten Roxette and before the group played their final show in Mexico City in September 2012, they had performed their classic song catalog in front of 1.5 million singing, screaming and crying people in 46 countries. A film team joined the tour and captured one of the most unexpected and moving returns any band has ever done.",

The spread of the virus is temporarily contained but, without a cure, it’s only a matter of time before it breaks its boundaries and the biggest problem of all… any zombies with combat skills are now enhanced. With the South East of England quarantined from the rest of the world using fortified borders, intelligence finds that the scientist responsible for the outbreak is alive and well in London. With his recovery being the only hope of a cure, a squad of eight Special Forces soldiers is sent on a suicide mission to the city, now ruled by the undead, with a single task: get him out alive within 72 hours by any means necessary. What emerges is an unlikely pairing on a course to save humanity against ever-rising odds.",

Shocked by Christ’s unexpected offer, Judas decides to join the apostles, if only to figure out what is going on. He gradually starts to comprehend Christ’s message, but feels that the apostles are blindly following their teacher. Judas argues with them, and tries to defend his right to divine the truth of God. But when he fails to make them understand, he realizes that Christ’s teachings may sink into oblivion without benefiting humanity. His solution is to betray Christ. “By killing a man, have I not saved a God?”",

Although it's all in the film: a dramatic fate, unknown pages of biography. Like any great actor, he possessed a secret - he did not tell both in the movies and in life. But his main gift was not even acting. Yankovsky was talented at making people fall in love with him. I wanted to look at him again and again: that's why they loved him and still love him.",

Yet, even within their central territories, some areas refused to bow to the Genghisids. Kozelsk was one of them.

When a young man dreams that he drowns after a night of carnal passion, he asks a buddhist monk to translate the experience for him. The monk replies that the dream is a warning not to indulge the pleasures of the flesh to excess, but the man ignores his advice, marrying a virgin and making love to her constantly. However, after several torrid affairs, the man begins to realise the sagacity of the monk's warning.",

To kick things up a notch, they decide – why not? – to make a video of themselves trying out every position in The Joy of Sex in one marathon three-hour session.  It seems like a great idea – until they discover that their most private video is no longer private.  With their reputations on the line, they know they’re just one click away from being laid bare to the world... but as their race to reclaim their video leads to a night they'll never forget, they'll find that their video will expose even more than they bargained for.",

That's when we meet her: at the age of 27 Nika is full of hopes and doubts regarding her gift. Due to the age restriction, she's got just one shot to enter the Drama School, and that's her only chance to separate from her cherishing and oppressive mother. Acquaintance with a new friend Ivan gives Nika hope for a happy future, but there is still something in her memory that triggers her. Tragically cheerful, painfully confused and desperately believing in love and life after childhood, Nika puts everything on the line to overcome ghosts of the past.",
