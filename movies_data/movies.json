The Fairy comes to town, touting his magic powers to cure the sick for anyone who'll pay his exorbitant fee. Ying Feng has some of the same talent, and cures a sick woman with no money and for no payment, thereby shaming The Fairy into both taking him on as a disciple and agreeing to charge less. Li Quan, the \"leader of black religion\", has not given up trying to find Ying Feng, but his search is greatly slowed down by his assistants being far more interested in screwing each other silly than revenge. Note - Both of the lead characters are actually called \"Fung\" in Cantonese, so I have used the Mandarin forms of their names, to distinguish them.",

When Maury gets his big break, Sam wants a part in his show, but when Maury, who is unwilling to cast Sam in the production, turns down Sam's request, Sam seduces and marries Maury's girlfriend (Shirley MacLaine). In spite of everything, Maury wants his girl back, and Sam agrees to a divorce on the stipulation that Maury cast him as the star in his next show. Once again, Maury reneges and, before Sam can exact his revenge, Uncle Sam comes to the rescue and he is drafted into the army.",

Seated in a park bench beside Sundararajan (Gemini Ganesan), Poori asks his name and as soon as he replies, he proclaims that Sundararajan is his father.  This creates complications in Sundararajan’s life and ruins his plans of marrying his lover Latha (Savithri). The president of a hospital for the mentally ill with a not-so-mentally-strong daughter creates more problems for the hero.  After many interesting twists and turns, the truth emerges — Poori is the illegitimate child of a soldier (Mustafa) and the abandoned mother commits suicide, leaving the child behind. Sundararajan ro and Latha are so attracted to Poori that they decide to adopt him.",

When a young man dreams that he drowns after a night of carnal passion, he asks a buddhist monk to translate the experience for him. The monk replies that the dream is a warning not to indulge the pleasures of the flesh to excess, but the man ignores his advice, marrying a virgin and making love to her constantly. However, after several torrid affairs, the man begins to realise the sagacity of the monk's warning.",

      "overview": "Over twenty-five years after his death in July 1989, the controversial Austrian conductor Herbert von Karajan remains an enigma. He was the most successful conductor in the history of classical music. Many of his recordings - of Italian opera, of Wagner and Richard Strauss, of Sibelius, Beethoven and Brahms - are treasured by music lovers around the world. Yet, even at the peak of his fame, his performances were variously criticised for being too opulent, too manicured, lacking warmth or spiritual depth.  This musical profile explores the many paradoxes in the life and music of this controversial figure, who forged his international reputation in London with the Philharmonia Orchestra shortly after the end of the Second World War and went on to reign supreme in the classical music world during his three decades with the Berlin Philharmonic. The film also examines Karajan's belief in the visual power of music, and his determination to leave behind a substantial legacy of music on film.",

Hideo's father, Takehiko, lusts after Kumi. Takehiko sends his son away, ostensibly on a business trip, but actually so that he can be murdered by Takehiko's henchmen. Takehiko seduces Kumi, but is frustrated when she refuses to perform oral sex on him. Angered, Takehiko forces Kumi to undergo surgery in which her clitoris is transferred to her throat, thereby requiring that she engage in oral sex in order to have an orgasm. Hideo, the supposedly murdered son, returns having paid off his assassins. Hideo shoots and kills his father, but Kumi grabs the gun and kills Hideo so that she can inherit the family's fortune",

Each girl dreams about meeting her love one day.  An experienced man helps her discover the world of passion and senses, and brings her to ‘heaven’s gate’ where the two of them will prevail.  One can only imagine how many hearts were broken along the way to master the science of love.  But passion blinds and soon the man becomes slave to the young woman’s sensual body.  The carnal knowledge makes the girl try to subdue her love object.  This is what the last film by Kim Ki-duk, shot in summer 2019 in Kyrgyzstan, is all about.  The film was finished by Kim’s friends and colleagues after he unexpectedly passed away in December 2020.",

He has made a mess of his life — his marriage is in trouble, since he is pathologically cheating on his wife; his parents (Yosef Millo and Orna Porat) have separated; and his father arrives for an extended visit from Nahariya. Giora spends time with his army buddies, recalling their experiences during the War in Lebanon. His father is undergoing a major life crisis and finds both the loneliness of the city and his son's lifestyle unappealing. As a non-Jew in a Jewish society, he feels estranged, an outsider who has never been able to adapt, and contemplates suicide. Eventually, Giora's parents decide to attempt a reconciliation, until tragedy strikes.",

However, his owner, Beni Ümeyye, does not approve of his conversion to Islam and pressures him to renounce his faith. Bilal, who endures all the torture inflicted upon him, is purchased by Prophet Muhammad's companion Abu Bakr, who grants him his freedom. Islam will begin to spread through the voice of Bilal-i Habeşi.",

In the 1920s, even the somewhat more tolerant people of the Netherlands (relative to the rest of Europe) did not easily suffer the open flouting of the rules of society. Cheerful and optimistic, Angela (Barbara Hershey) defied the conventions of her conservative Dutch family by traipsing about the countryside with her lover, living on what turned up each day. However, even for the sunniest of optimists such an idyll can have tragic consequences.",

Renowned for his boxing skills, speed and ability to slip punches, the famed southpaw became an oriental champion at all weights from bantamweight to lightweight. To this day, Elorde holds the junior lightweight division for the longest title reign of nearly seven-and-a-half years, defending the crown he won with a spectacular 7th round knockout of Harold Gomes before 26,000 screaming fans at the inauguration of the Araneta Coliseum on March 16, 1960, 10 times against the top contenders. Elorde was the first Asian inducted into the New York-based International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1993 and was also enshrined in the World Boxing Hall of Fame. With his skills and humility both inside and outside the ring, \"Flash\" Elorde will always remain a tribute to the sport. He was a quintessential Filipino who \"feared no man but was humble before all men.\"",

Gregor’s life goes on, but he is confused and searches everywhere for a sign of his brother’s whereabouts. The more Gregor realises how little he knows about his brother, the more he becomes fascinated by these things he doesn't know. And the longer Pietschi remains missing, the more obsessed Gregor becomes with his brother’s fading echo, even going so far as to try and slip into his brother’s life. But what happens when one of them suddenly disappears from the mirror image? Can the other continue to be the person they are. Or rather, were?",
